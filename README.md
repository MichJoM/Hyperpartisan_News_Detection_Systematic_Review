# Hyperpartisan_News_Detection_Systematic_Review

Contained within this repository are the search findings pertaining to our systematic review on detecting hyperpartisan news, conducted in adherence to the PRISMA guidelines. To replicate these results, we recommend employing the identical advanced query method detailed in our paper.


## Contents

### Search Results

  ProQuest_q2.ris: Contains the raw results from ProQuest database.
  Scholar.bib: Contains the raw results from Google Scholar database search.
  ScienceDirect_q2.bib: Contains the raw results from Science Direct database.
  acm.enw: Contains the raw results from ACM database.
  scopus_q2.bib: Contains the raw results from Scopus database.
  IEEExplorer.csv: Contains the raw results from IEEExplorer database.

### Screened papers
all_studies.pdf and all_studies.csv are a numbered table of all studies identified in the literature search, including those that were excluded from the analyses. This table contains the name of the annotators and the exclusion reasons in the column "notes". The column "annotation_date" indicate the date for each annotation. We respected PLOS ONE's table guidelines. Nonetheless, due to all_studies.pdf size, we recommend to open all_studies.csv. 

### Primary research sources for the systematic review
primary_data.pdf and primary_data.csv are a numbered table of the studies identified applying the inclusion criteria. The table includes: the name of data extractors and date of data extraction under the column "notes"; the confirmation that the study was eligible to be included in the review; the date of data extraction and all the data extracted from each study for the reported systematic review that would be needed to replicate your analyses. This data are described in the remaining columns. We respected PLOS ONE's table guidelines. Nonetheless, due to primary_data.pdf size, we recommend to open primary_data.csv. 

### Risk of bias
The files CASP_bias_analysis_paper.pdf and CASP_bias_analysis_paper.csv contain detailed table showing the completed risk of bias and quality/certainty assessments for each study. We applied the CASP checklist (https://casp-uk.net/casp-tools-checklists/).

### Handling missing data
During the screening process all the papers have been successfully retrieved. 
When authors did not provide information, we inserted N/A in the corresponding cell (e.g. missing metrics). 
In the table describing datasets (Table 8), the column "Dataset" reports the name of the dataset indicated by authors. When authors did not provide any, we inserted "No Name" in the corresponding cell. 

### Usage
  To replicate our methodology and validate our findings:
  - Read the section "Methodology" in our paper, in order to understand the databases used and the keywords combinations used to retrieve documents.
  - Open the abovementioned files to inspect the articles initially identified and select them considering titles and abstracts.
  - Upload the files into Rayyan and ResearchRabbit to understand the selected set of paper included in our systematic review.
