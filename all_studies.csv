It is often perceived to have increased political polarization, thanks to the scale of discussions and their public nature. Automatic political ideology detection allows us to identify the bias of information sources as well as professionals such as journalists. It has also become a relevant area due to its successful application to user behaviour analysis and prediction of malicious user versus legitimate user. This paper describes our participation at PoliticEs@IberLEF2022 shared task, whose goal is classify the political ideology of a person as well as other related information such as profession or gender.

In response, scholars have prioritized the study of the antecedents and outcomes of citizen's ability to detect so-called ‘fake news’. Growing evidence supports the cognitive involvement hypothesis, which states that deeper reflection and elaboration on news content increases one's tendency to correctly identify fake news. This study adds to this literature by exploring connections between reliance on social media for news and emergent scholarship on the News Finds Me Perception (NFMP). We argue that the NFMP represents a low-effort cognitive style of attention to news and therefore, high NFMP respondents are more likely to evaluate fake news as credible. Furthermore, we examine whether this association holds despite partisan affiliation. Panel survey data from the United States provide robust evidence that the NFMP is associated with inaccurate assessments of both apolitical and pro-conservative fake news stories. Moderation analyses show that NFMP is a boundary condition for media effects; reliance on social media for news only leads to fake news acceptance when people hold the NFMP, and this effect exacerbates partisan motivated reasoning.

Opinion surveys identified the importance of political ideology in shaping perceptions of the pandemic and compliance with preventive measures. Objective: The aim of this study was to measure political partisanship and antiscience attitudes in the discussions about the pandemic on social media, as well as their geographic and temporal distributions. Methods: We analyzed a large set of tweets from Twitter related to the pandemic, collected between January and May 2020, and developed methods to classify the ideological alignment of users along the moderacy (hardline vs moderate), political (liberal vs conservative), and science (antiscience vs proscience) dimensions. Results: We found a significant correlation in polarized views along the science and political dimensions. Moreover, politically moderate users were more aligned with proscience views, while hardline users were more aligned with antiscience views. Contrary to expectations, we did not find that polarization grew over time; instead, we saw increasing activity by moderate proscience users. We also show that antiscience conservatives in the United States tended to tweet from the southern and northwestern states, while antiscience moderates tended to tweet from the western states. The proportion of antiscience conservatives was found to correlate with COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our findings shed light on the multidimensional nature of polarization and the feasibility of tracking polarized opinions about the pandemic across time and space through social media data. ©Ashwin Rao, Fred Morstatter, Minda Hu, Emily Chen, Keith Burghardt, Emilio Ferrara, Kristina Lerman.","Export Date: 27 October 2023; Cited By: 27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_pertinent_data",10.2196/26692,COVID-19;Infodemic;Infodemiology;Infoveillance;Multidimensional polarization;Social media;Social network;Twitter;Humans;Internet Use;Politics;SARS-CoV-2;Social Media;Telemedicine;algorithm;Article;classification;content analysis;coronavirus disease 2019;expectation;geographic distribution;human;ideology;medical information;pandemic;patient attitude;politics;public health;public opinion;science;search engine;social media;social network;text messaging;United States;telemedicine;therapy,,,07/11/2023

Character assassination against climate scientists and policymakers is the most common type of misinformation strategy used by contrarians in climate debates (Coan, T. G., Boussalis, C., Cook, J., & Nanko, M. O. (2021). Computer-assisted classification of contrarian claims about climate change. Scientific Reports, 11(1), 22320). Despite its widespread use, however, character assassination remains understudied by social scientists, especially in the context of climate change. This study adapts Douglas Walton’s (1998. Ad hominem arguments. University of Alabama Press) typology of ‘ad hominem’ attacks–personal attacks targeting an individual’s character, competence, or motives–to misinformation campaigns against the climate community. We developed an original codebook for classifying ad hominem arguments made by climate contrarians. Drawing on a 553-paragraph sample from a corpus from 55 contrarian blogs and 15 conservative think-tank websites published in English between 2008 and 2020, we then determined the relative prominence of each type of attack using a consensus-coding approach. Bias attacks, which entail accusing climate scientists of political partisanship or having an ideological agenda, were the most common form of contrarian ad hominem attack. The dominance of bias attacks can be explained by their strong relevance for scientific credibility. The study found that ad hominem attacks, often with bias and moral attacks clustered together, are the most common combination. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for climate policy and future research. Key Policy Insights: Climate misinformation politicizes climate science, further amplifying ideological conflict and fostering ideological polarization; Climate misinformation campaigns feature a range of different types of ad hominem attacks designed to undermine the credibility of climate scientists; The most common type of ad hominem attack on climate scientists in our sample was bias attacks, which entail accusing climate scientists of political partisanship or of having an ideological agenda; Attacks on the moral character of climate scientists were the only type of ad hominem that increased during the period under study (2008–2020); Different types of ad hominems often appeared together, with the most common combination being bias and moral attacks; Ad hominem attacks on climate scientists are part of misinformation campaigns designed to stall discussion on climate change and delay the implementation of climate policies. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Export Date: 27 October 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_political_detection_task",10.1080/14693062.2023.2245792,Ad hominem;bias;climate change policies;climate science;misinformation;moral attack,,,07/11/2023

A sample of 1200 US respondents were randomly assigned to a control and four messaging treatments that included information about risks of COVID-19 on own health, public health, the economy, and combination of public health and the economy, respectively. Our results indicate a significant difference in messaging uptake based on political partisanship. Individuals identifying as Democrats increased their social distancing and stay-at-home decisions in response to all information treatments, contrary to Republicans who showed no significant change in their behavior. Using a latent class analysis model, we classify individuals into three main types (dismissive, amenable, and conscious) that differ in their perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19. We show that only amenable individuals, who account for approximately 34% of the sample, respond significantly to the messaging treatments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 27 October 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_pertinent",10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105300,COVID-19;Information framing;Prevention strategies;Social distancing;Classification (of information);Health risks;Public risks;Risk assessment;Risk perception;Economic risks;Health crisis;Health informations;Information treatment;Quick response;Wellbeing;adult;Article;behavior change;clinical effectiveness;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;decision making;economic aspect;female;health care policy;health hazard;health promotion;home quarantine;human;male;medical information;pandemic;perception;priority journal;public health;risk assessment;social distancing;social participation;United States;Public health,,,07/11/2023

The political polarization on Twitter is vital to politicians as it is a popular public medium to analyze and predict public opinion concerning political events. The analysis of the sentiment of political tweet contents mainly depends on the quality of sentiment lexicons. Therefore, it is crucial to create sentiment lexicons of the highest quality. In the proposed system, the domain-specific of the political lexicon is constructed by using the supervised approach to extract extreme political opinions words, and features in tweets. Political multi-class sentiment analysis (PMSA) system on the big data platform is developed to predict the inclination of tweets to infer the results of the elections by conducting the analysis on different political datasets: including the Trump election dataset and the BBC News politics. The comparative analysis is the experimental results which are better political text classification by using the three different models (multinomial naïve Bayes (MNB), decision tree (DT), linear support vector classification (SVC)). In the comparison of three different models, linear SVC has the better performance than the other two techniques.

The dissemination of false, misleading, or biased information can adversely affect society and can threaten democracy by precluding healthy, fact-based political discourse. The circulation of false or distorted news can sow distrust and fear among the public, culminating in the propagation of conspiracy theories. Not only can this exacerbate political partisanship, but also it can make it difficult to enforce unpopular, yet necessary, legislation as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it would be naïve to place all the blame for the spread of such misinformation on social media platforms, it is undeniable that social networks have allowed fake news to prosper as never before. Numerous studies have investigated how best to fight this phenomenon, oftentimes exploiting powerful Artificial Intelligence techniques. Yet, they suffer from a limitation when dealing with such an elusive problem in that they assume a simple dichotomy between real and fake news. In this chapter, we propose a new finer-grained taxonomy for online news content that goes well beyond this binary distinction. We investigate the feasibility of categorizing texts according to this new classification scheme, using datasets extracted from Reddit, and a crowdsourcing-based evaluation. Then based on these classifiers, we prototype a system for assisting journalists with their fact-checking activities, helping them to identify claims in political transcripts and retrieve passages from news articles that may provide evidence supporting or refuting those claims. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Anitha S.

Accordingly, there has been much research on political polarization, including many recent efforts that take a computational perspective. By detecting political biases in a text document, one can attempt to discern and describe its polarity. Intuitively, the named entities (i.e., the nouns and the phrases that act as nouns) and hashtags in text often carry information about political views. For example, people who use the term “pro-choice” are likely to be liberal and people who use the term “pro-life” are likely to be conservative. In this paper, we seek to reveal political polarities in social-media text data and to quantify these polarities by explicitly assigning a polarity score to entities and hashtags. Although this idea is straightforward, it is difficult to perform such inference in a trustworthy quantitative way. Key challenges include the small number of known labels, the continuous spectrum of political views, and the preservation of both a polarity score and a polarity-neutral semantic meaning in an embedding vector of words. To attempt to overcome these challenges, we propose the Polarity-aware Embedding Multi-task learning (PEM) model. This model consists of (1) a self-supervised context-preservation task, (2) an attention-based tweet-level polarity-inference task, and (3) an adversarial learning task that promotes independence between an embedding’s polarity component and its semantic component. Our experimental results demonstrate that our PEM model can successfully learn polarity-aware embeddings that perform well at tweet-level and account-level classification tasks. We examine a variety of applications—including a study of spatial and temporal distributions of polarities and a comparison between tweets from Twitter and posts from Parler—and we thereby demonstrate the effectiveness of our PEM model. We also discuss important limitations of our work and encourage caution when applying the PEM model to real-world scenarios. © 2023, The Author(s).","Export Date: 27 October 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_political_detection_task",10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00386-6,Adversarial training;Data sets;Multi-task learning;Political-polarity detection;Word embeddings;Natural language processing systems;Semantics;Social networking (online);Data set;Embeddings;Hashtags;Learning models;Multitask learning;Named entities;Political views;Word embedding;Bias (Epidemiology),,,07/11/2023

Some determinants relate to the ecosystem of media and social networks, such as the availability and rapid spread of fake news, the unselected information on platforms and the fact that consumers can become creators of fake news. Cognitive factors are important, such as confirmation bias, political partisanship, prior exposure and intuitive thinking. Low science knowledge and low educational level are also involved. Psychological factors include attraction to novelty, high emotional state, and the emotionally evocative content of fake news. High digital literacy protects against believing fake news. Sociological factors such as online communities, or echo chambers, and the role of pressure groups have been identified. The implication for practice can be deduced, including education in media literacy and warning tips, reliable journalism and fact-checking, social media regulation, partnership of media platforms’ with fact-checkers, warning messages on networks, and digital detection solutions.

The spread of this type of misinformation is a severe danger to social cohesiveness and well-being since it increases political polarisation and people's distrust of their leaders. Thus, fake news is a phenomenon that is having a significant impact on our social lives, particularly in politics. This paper proposes novel approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) for the fake news detection system to address this phenomenon. The main aim of this paper is to find the optimal model that obtains high accuracy performance. Therefore, we propose an optimized Convolutional Neural Network model to detect fake news (OPCNN-FAKE). We compare the performance of the OPCNN-FAKE with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and The six regular ML techniques: Decision Tree (DT), logistic Regression (LR), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) using four fake news benchmark datasets. Grid search and hyperopt optimization techniques have been used to optimize the parameters of ML and DL, respectively. In addition, N-gram and Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) have been used to extract features from the benchmark datasets for regular ML, while Glove word embedding has been used to represent features as a feature matrix for DL models. To evaluate the performance of the OPCNN-FAKE, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measure were applied to validate the results. The results show that OPCNN-FAKE model has achieved the best performance for each dataset compared with other models. Furthermore, the OPCNN-FAKE has a higher performance of cross-validation results and testing results over the other models, which indicates that the OPCNN-FAKE for fake news detection is significantly better than the other models.  © 2013 IEEE.","Export Date: 27 October 2023; Cited By: 48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_political_detection_task",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3112806,convolutional neural network;deep learning;detection;Fake news;machine learning;neural network;OPCNN-FAKE;Barium compounds;Benchmarking;Convolution;Convolutional neural networks;Decision trees;Deep learning;Inverse problems;Logistic regression;Nearest neighbor search;Support vector machines;Support vector regression;Text processing;Benchmark datasets;Cross validation;Detection system;Feature matrices;Inverse Document Frequency;K nearest neighbor (KNN);Optimization techniques;Recurrent neural network (RNN);Long short-term memory;Nerve Net;Neural Networks (Computer),,,07/11/2023

Furthermore, while Franke proposes that algorithmic political classifications entrench political identities, I contend that they may often produce the opposite result. They can lead people to change in ways that disconfirm the classifications (thus causing ‘looping effects’). Consequently and counterintuitively, algorithmic political bias can in fact decrease political entrenchment and polarization. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 27 October 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_pertinent",10.1007/s13347-022-00576-6,Algorithmic political bias;Looping effects;Political entrenchment;Political polarization;Bias (Epidemiology);Algorithms,,,07/11/2023

This environment has real consequences with great impact on our lives like severe political polarization, easy spread of fake news, political extremism, hate groups and the lack of enriching debates, among others. Therefore, encouraging conversations between different groups of users and breaking the closed community is of importance for healthy societies. In this paper, we characterize and study users who change their community on Twitter using natural language processing techniques and graph machine learning algorithms. In particular, we collected 9 million Twitter messages from 1.5 million users and constructed retweet networks. We identified their communities and topics of discussion associated with them. With this data, we present a machine learning framework for social media users classification which detects users that swing from their closed community to another one. A feature importance analysis in three Twitter polarized political datasets showed that these users have low values of PageRank, suggesting that changes in community are driven because their messages have no resonance in their original communities. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Despite the growth in independent voter identity, many political strategists still view independents as partisans. In this article, we contribute to the academic literature on independent voting behavior by exploring whether those who identify as politically independent function as true independents by accounting for their voting patterns over time. We do this by analyzing data produced by the American National Election Studies (ANES) on political identification and voting choices from 1972 to 2020 on each of the three ANES measures of party affiliation. Our findings show when tracking independent voting behavior over more than one election, there is a significant volatility in voting loyalty and independents as a group are distinct from partisans. This volatility was observed in all three measures of party affiliation used by the ANES survey data. The research also finds evidence that a sizeable number of independents move in and out of independent status from one election to another.

Popular strategies for mitigating misinformation include crowdsourcing, machine learning, and media literacy programs that require social media users to classify news in binary terms as either true or false. However, research on peer influence suggests that framing decisions in binary terms can amplify judgment errors and limit social learning, whereas framing decisions in probabilistic terms can reliably improve judgments. In this preregistered experiment, we compare online peer networks that collaboratively evaluated the veracity of news by communicating either binary or probabilistic judgments. Exchanging probabilistic estimates of news veracity substantially improved individual and group judgments, with the effect of eliminating polarization in news evaluation. By contrast, exchanging binary classifications reduced social learning and maintained polarization. The benefits of probabilistic social learning are robust to participants’ education, gender, race, income, religion, and partisanship. © 2021 Guilbeault et al.

In this research, we integrate truth bias, elaboration likelihood model and new media literacy into a model for explaining social media engagement (with both disinformation and factual information) and analysing how political polarisation (operationalised as political alignment between users) influences perceptions and behaviours. Using an experimental design, we analyse the model separately for posts containing disinformation and factual information, highlighting key differences. Political alignment positively moderates truth bias's effect on engagement with disinformation. For both disinformation and factual information, political alignment moderates the effect of generalised communicative suspicion (GCS) on truth bias, such that GCS's effect on truth bias flips from negative to positive as political alignment increases. Issue involvement and political alignment appear to be the primary drivers of disinformation engagement, with critical consuming media literacy failing to mitigate engagement.

Based on social identity theory, in-group members should consider their politician’s message truthful while the opposing out-group would consider the message deceptive. Truth-default theory predicts that a salient in-group would be susceptible to deception from their in-group politician. In an experiment, partisan voters in the United States (N = 618) watched a news interview in which a politician was labeled Democratic or Republican. The politician either answered all the questions or deceptively evaded a question. Results indicated that the truth bias largely prevailed. Voters were more likely to be accurate in their detection when the politician answered and did not dodge. Truth-default theory appears robust in a political setting, as truth bias holds (as opposed to deception bias). Accuracy in detection also depends on group affiliation. In-groups are accurate when their politician answers, and inaccurate when he dodges. Out-groups are more accurate than in-groups when a politician dodges, but still exhibit truth bias. © The Author(s) 2017.","Export Date: 27 October 2023; Cited By: 24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_methodology",10.1177/0261927X17744004,deception detection;political news interview;social identity theory;truth-default theory;article;controlled study;deception;human;interview;major clinical study;male;perception;public figure;social status;United States;Bias (Epidemiology);Deception,,,07/11/2023

In addition, the author compares Russian and Western think tanks, reveals their main differences, systematizes their problems and proposes several original ways of resolving these challenges facing the academic community both in Russia and the U.S. today. The article's relevance is explained with the fact that today nobody, even experts and academics, are immune to fake news and ""disruptive technologies"", with their ideas and expertise frequently taken out of context and used in the goal of manipulation, as exemplified by the case of The Brookings Institution and The Atlantic Council in February 2017. Moreover, the lack of demand of academic expertise in political circles during Donald Trump's presidency, the plight of Russia Studies programs and International Relations schools in the U.S. as well as partisanship within think tanks only aggravate the problem of today's ideas industry.

This form of news reporting, especially via social media campaigns has boosted the access and fabrication of bogus reporting, or what is referred to as fake news. Fake news, in the form of clickbait, hoax, satire, propaganda, hyperpartisan, deepfakes, or simply unreliable news has the power of influencing its readers to a dangerous extent, predominantly causing political, socio-economic, or psychological harm. In this chapter, we analyze the meaning of fake news in the world of social media, the various forms it can take, what causes its spread, and what are the rudimentary signs of such fake news. We will walk through a comparative study of the state-of-the-art deep learning models to approach the tasks of identifying phony information, verifying the validity of various claims and facts, catching fake content, and so on. The exposition will especially elucidate the adversarial approaches in deep learning to detect counterfeit content that could come in any form like text, images, videos, or audio. In doing so, we establish the importance of generating plausible and understandable explanations for model predictions with a special emphasis on algorithm fairness. With the fact that deep learning methods rely on comparatively larger datasets of top-notch quality, this chapter will also highlight the availability of relevant datasets in this space, as well as share pointers to curate one if needed. Even with sufficient data, however, detection problems in this domain are especially challenging since spammers and fake content generators are working tirelessly to evolve their strategies in parallel to the advancement in detection mechanisms.

Given that individuals are persuaded to follow party lines while having the opportunity and incentives to collaborate with members of the opposite party, our goal is to measure the extent to which legislators tend to form ideological relationships with members of the opposite party. We quantify the level of cooperation, or lack thereof, between Democrat and Republican Party members in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949–2012. We define a network of over 5 million pairs of representatives, and compare the mutual agreement rates on legislative decisions between two distinct types of pairs: those from the same party and those formed of members from different parties. We find that despite short-term fluctuations, partisanship or non-cooperation in the U.S. Congress has been increasing exponentially for over 60 years with no sign of abating or reversing. Yet, a group of representatives continue to cooperate across party lines despite growing partisanship.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2015 Andris et al.

The way in which Google operates as a company and generates revenue is often sidelined in academic discussions regarding the cultural implications of how its search engine functions. Almost 90% of Googleâ€™s revenue is derived from advertising, despite Larry Page and Sergey Brinâ€™s original academic paper regarding Google in which they argue that advertising produces mixed motives that make it an unfeasible way to fund search engines. This article outlines how Googleâ€™s model of advertising reflects and encourages wider changes in capitalism as it shifts from its twentieth-century Fordist incarnation to contemporary Post-Fordist arrangements of labour. In doing so, this article analyses Googleâ€™s two main advertising systems, AdWords and AdSense, and proposes that these financial models have significant effects upon online discourse. In discussing AdWords, this article details some of the tensions between the local and the global that develop when tracing flows of information and capital, specifically highlighting Googleâ€™s impact on the decline of online language diversity. In outlining AdSense, this article demonstrates how Googleâ€™s hegemonic control prescribes which parts of the web can be monetised and which remain unprofitable. In particular, in drawing from existing studies, evidence is provided that Googleâ€™s AdSense programme, along with Googleâ€™s relationship with Facebook, incentivised the rise of fake news in the 2016 US presidential election. This work builds on existing scholarship to demonstrate that Googleâ€™s economic influence has varied and far-reaching effects in a number of contexts and is relevant to scholars in a range of disciplines. As such, this article is intended as a discursive introduction to the topic and does not require specific disciplinary background knowledge. In doing so, this article does not attempt to provide the final word on Googleâ€™s relationship to digital capitalism, but rather, demonstrate the profitability of a Post-Fordist perspective, in order to enable a wider engagement with the issues identified.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2017.

The first concerns how social media have oftentimes been criticized for not being â€˜good dataâ€™ at least in the sense that the fields in the databases are unstable overtime, and that the introduction of new ones leads to interactive complexity. For example, on Facebook the â€˜reactionsâ€™ that were introduced in 2016 interfered with the stability of â€˜likesâ€™, given the new choices in how to react to a post. The critique extends beyond the data fields. Even the metrics used by the corporations evolve, such as the definition of reach on Facebookâ€™s CrowdTangle, as a researcher found after publishing findings on Russian disinformation Pages on Facebook (Timberg 2017). ","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2018.

These pathways have also been usurped by both â€œnon-state and state actors who aim not only to disseminate misinformation but, most damaging, to erode trust in traditional sources of information.â€[1] This has created a political, national, and homeland security environment that often calls into question the very nature of truth and reality. Whatâ€™s more, outrageous conspiracy theories, once ascribed to the fringes of society, are now being normalized and incorporated into mainstream dialogues. When people talk about this problem, however, they typically point to social media, or even specifically to a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter, as if social media are solely responsible for the degradation of truth. While these platforms do seem to play a role, the internet itself has become a social platform and, through the dynamism and instructiveness of almost all websites, apps, and internet platforms, a new global infrastructure for communication, sharing, and outrage has formed. This has created an online space that, for its complex, interconnected ecosystem, requires a new paradigm for human understanding of truth and cognitive security. In 2012, one researcher—Adam Klein—recognized the potential role the totality of the internet plays in normalizing racist rhetoric; through his foundational work, we can begin to see a framework for understanding the phenomenon we are facing. In Kleinâ€™s original model, information laundering is described as the process by which â€œthe Internetâ€™s unique properties allow subversive social movements to not only grow globally, but also to quietly legitimize their causes through a borrowed network of associations.â€[2] Taking into account the amalgamation of conspiracy theories, â€œfake news,â€ propaganda, and weaponized narratives spouted by extremist groups, combined with technological advancements and a growing awareness of propagandaâ€™s effectiveness, it is perhaps time to modify this model. This thesis therefore proposes the Information Laundering 2.0 model. This research demonstrates how the interconnectedness of various internet platforms, coupled with existing and emerging online technologies, can be exploited to launder false or purposefully misleading information into public discourse at a volume and velocity previously unimaginable. It is important to study this phenomenon because this ongoing threat continues to raise difficult discussions among homeland security professionals, policymakers, and the general public, often creating an uncomfortable dialogue in which partisanship, freedom of speech, and privacy laws come into play. Nonetheless, establishing a practical framework, the Information Laundering 2.0 model, to help explain this phenomenon is a crucial step toward effective and sustainable actions to combat it. Beginning with a foundation of propaganda research, this thesis builds a new concept, dubbed counterfeit narrative, to define the content of the propaganda being spread online. The counterfeit narrative concept helps explain the flawed nature of this information and accounts for the potential actors who could leverage its use, including nation-states, terrorist organizations, domestic extremists, and even corporations engaging in disingenuous advertising campaigns. More so than terms like â€œfake newsâ€ or â€œconspiracy theories,â€ counterfeit narrative more effectively capture the nuances of the disinformation, the actors disseminating it, and the spreadability of that propaganda online. Additionally, the current internet ecosystem, including the ease with which a consumer can both find and contribute to information, creates a very influential environment. It allows truthful, important information to spread at previously impossible rates, but at the same time opens up the floodgates for the rapid spread of counterfeit narratives. Propagandists can use online technologies such as computational propaganda, echo chambers, and advertising to further cheat the internet ecosystem and create and spread content that is more influential and believable. Committed actors can leverage these techniques to intentionally undermine the credibility of legitimate sources by leveling the playing field for subversive, often extremist, content that masquerades as credible content in the public debate. Information Laundering 2.0 considers the concepts of counterfeit narrative and accelerators (technologies used to spread counterfeit narratives faster), as well as the internet ecosystem itself and actors who take advantage of existing propaganda campaigns. The model is broken into three phases: placement, layering, and integration. The placement phase prepares the information, in the form of a counterfeit narrative, for maximum impact before it is placed into the internet ecosystem. Next, in the layering phase, the counterfeit narrative is laundered through a series of domains and connections until it has reached a virality and veracity that opens it up for public discourse, without the original source or motive being understood. During the layering phase, the propagandist may take advantage of accelerators—in the form of online advertising, computational propaganda, and echo chambers—in an effort to speed up the impact of the process. Additionally, amplifiers, or actors who enhance the campaigns of other information launderers for either ideological or financial purposes, may also come into play during the layering phase. Upon successful laundering, the narrative enters the integration phase and becomes part of public discourse and knowledge. While the Information Laundering 2.0 model does not offer a simple, step-by-step solution for combating this complex problem, it helps frame the issue in a way that homeland security professionals, law enforcement, policymakers, and the general public can understand. It leverages real-world solutions at multiple levels while protecting free speech, and without sacrificing our nationâ€™s cognitive security. The Information Laundering 2.0 model should be the framework used and understood when addressing global, governmental, societal, and individual responses to this continuous threat. We must identify solutions that address the problem at every phase (placement, layering, and integration) and through every piece (enablers, accelerators, and amplifiers). Any proposed solutions for combatting information laundering should be considered with a multi-level, multi-disciplinary, and multi-sector approach. This research should therefore not be seen as the definitive guide to ending information laundering, but only as a place to start the conversation, start the research, and start the response. Solutions to be considered include identifying strategies to prevent counterfeit narratives from entering the online ecosystem all together, rebuilding trust and legitimacy of online institutions, slowing down the technology that speeds up counterfeit narratives, limiting malicious actorsâ€™ ability to amplify existing campaigns for either ideological or financial purposes, and inoculating the public against information laundering before it happens. Further, from a holistic perspective, considering access to truthful information as a right and information laundering itself as a crime may help combat the issue. Finally, restructuring our education system and the publicâ€™s awareness, especially as it relates to consumption of sources online, is also important. The United States must immediately recognize and seek to understand the concepts of counterfeit narratives and information laundering, as well as the threats they pose to democracy, freedom, and homeland security. Policymakers should tackle these issues with laws that are not too broad to limit free speech or freedom of the press, but effective enough to provide citizens with their right to be â€œsecure in their personsâ€ by establishing and defending cognitive security. Meanwhile, law enforcement and homeland security officials should make efforts to prepare for, and help mitigate, the confusion and tension that ultimately arise from these narratives and prepare to protect themselves and the general public from incidents that, without intervention, could escalate to violence.

As similar research reveals, digital disinformation affects resilience of citizens in Member States and in the European Union overall, it ""threatens the democratic political processes and values"" (European Commission, 2018: 12), the integrity of elections and political processes, and should therefore, be approached as a legitimate public concern.

There is much debate in the social sciences and communications fields about the applicability of this concept. We believe that the term ""hyper-partisan media"", which is used in part of the literature, provides a better understanding of the phenomenon. We also argue that it is important to understand that hyper-partisanship emerged as a result of the polarisation of the public sphere. In this article, we analyse the dissemination of hyper-partisan news one week before the judges' vote in the trial of former president Lula at the TRF-4 (Tribunal Regional Federal da 4a regiÃ£o, or the Federal Regional Court of the 4th Region). We show how the headlines of the stories that were shared the most on social media during that period fit into one of the two polarised narratives currently dominating the Brazilian public sphere. We conclude the article with an assessment of possible approaches to regulation on this issue.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2018.

We review the evidence positing that online interactions lead to filter bubbles to test whether echo chambers are restricted to online patterns of interaction or are associated with physical, in-person interaction. We identify the location of users, estimate their partisan affiliation, and finally calculate the distance between sender and receiver of @-mentions and retweets. We show that polarized online echo-chambers map onto geographically situated social networks. More specifically, our results reveal that echo chambers in the Leave campaign are associated with geographic proximity and that the reverse relationship holds true for the Remain campaign. The study concludes with a discussion of primary and secondary effects arising from the interaction between existing physical ties and online interactions and argues that the collapsing of distances brought by internet technologies may foreground the role of geography within oneâ€™s social network.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2018 Bastos et al.

Given differences between conservatives and liberals in threat sensitivity and dangerous-world beliefs, correlations between political orientation and negatively-biased credulity may thus reflect endogenous mindsets. Alternatively, such results may owe to the political hierarchy at the time of previous research, as the tendency to see dark forces at work is thought to be greater among those who are out of political power. Adjudicating between these accounts can inform how societies respond to the challenge of alarmist disinformation campaigns. We exploit the consequences of the 2016 U.S. elections to test these competing explanations of differences in negatively-biased credulity and conspiracism as a function of political orientation. Two studies of Americans reveal continued positive associations between conservatism, negatively-biased credulity, and conspiracism despite changes to the power structure in conservativesâ€™ favor.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2018 Samore et al.

The campaign originated in the US with an anonymous Twitter account that enlisted followers in encouraging brands to pull their online advertising from Breitbart News. The campaign achieved dramatic success and rapidly spread to regions outside the US, with other anonymously run and loosely allied chapters emerging in 15 different nations (as well as a regional chapter for the EU). Many of these were initially created to take on Breitbart advertisers in their home countries, but in a number of cases they subsequently turned their attention to disrupting financial support for other far-right news media in—or impacting—their home countries. Based on interviews with leaders of eight Sleeping Giants chapters, as well as the related UK-based Stop Funding Hate campaign, this study examines the Sleeping Giants campaign with respect to its continuity with media activism of previous eras, while also seeking to understand its potential as one of the first high-profile activist campaigns to grapple with the impacts of programmatic advertising on the news ecosystem. In particular, we consider how the campaignâ€™s interventions speak to the larger debate around the normative relationship between advertising and the performance of the news ecosystem.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2019.

The paper begins with a brief overview of fake news. This is followed presentations of various models identified in a two-volume survey of informing science. The models presented include those dealing with extrinsic (i.e., environmental) complexity, informing transitions, and individual resonance. The potential implications for informing science research into fake news are discussed and questions that may warrant future research are raised. The paper then concludes by describing what current informing science may already be telling us about fake news, its spread and its influence. Through its analysis of the fake news and informing science literature, a number of questions are identified where informing science can possibly contribute to our understanding of fake news. These include: &bull; Does fake news need to disinform its clients if it is to be effective? &bull; Why are certain groups of individuals particularly credible when it comes to communicating fake news? &bull; Under what circumstances will the emotional and social motivations to accept fake news exceed our concern for its truth? &bull; How does the nature of the fake news content and objectives impact the disinformerâ€™s choice of channel? &bull; What are the circumstances under which radically transitional fake news might have an impact?","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2019.

Social media platforms enable users to publish and share their own generated content with little or no restrictions. However, this gives an opportunity for the spread of inaccurate or misleading content, which can badly affect usersâ€™ beliefs and decisions. This is why credibility assessment of social media content has recently received tremendous attention. The majority of the studies in the literature focused on identifying features that provide a high predictive power when fed to data mining models and select the model with the highest predictive performance given those features. Results of these studies are conflicting regarding the best model. Additionally, they disregarded the fact that real-time credibility assessment is needed and thus time and resources consumption is crucial for model selection. This study tries to fill this gap by investigating the performance of different data mining techniques for credibility assessments in terms of both functional and operational characteristics for a balanced evaluation that considers both model performance and interoperability.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2019.

But the other impact of the presence of social media opens an ample space for the existence of information or hoax news about an event that is troubling the public. The hoax also provides cynical provocation, which is inciting hatred, anger, incitement to many people, directly influencing behavior so that it responds as desired by the hoax makers. Fake news is playing an increasingly dominant role in spreading Misinformation by influencing people's Perceptions or knowledge to distort their awareness and decision-making. A framework is develope dataset collection of hoax gathered using web crawlers from several websites, using classification techniques. This hoax news will be categorized into several detection parameters including, page URL, title hoax news, publish date, author, and content. Matching each word hoax using the similarity algorithm to produce the accuracy of the hoax news uses the rule-based detection method. Experiments were carried out on eleven thousand-hoax news used as training datasets and testing data sets; this data set for validation using similarity algorithms, to produce the highest accuracy of hoax text similarity. In this study, each hoax news will label into four categories, namely, Fact, Hoax, Information, Unknown. Contributions propose Automatic detection of hoax news, Automatic Multilanguage Detection, and a collection of datasets that we gather ourselves and validation that results in four categories of hoax news that have measured in terms of text similarity using similarity techniques. Further research can be continued by adding objects hate speech, black campaign, blockchain technique to ward off hoaxes, or can produce algorithms that produce better text accuracy.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2019.

After reviewing key tenets of recent debates, I advance a specific understanding of the concept – critical digital literacy – that, as I argue, comprehensively addresses issues of knowledge, competencies, and skills in relation to digital technologies. In particular, I posit that critical thinking about educational and other values of â€˜the digitalâ€™ needs to take structural aspects of the technology into account that are often eschewed in instrumental or commercially-driven approaches. To prepare pupils for their future lives requires a widest possible contextualisation of technology, including issues of exploitation, commodification, and degradation in digital capitalism. Finally, I make concrete suggestions for constructive uses of technology in teaching and learning.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2019.

We compare active users to this set of political bots with respect to temporal tweeting behavior, the size and speed of retweet cascades, and the composition of their retweet cascades (user-to-bot vs. bot-to-bot) to evidence strategies for bot deployment. Our results move forward the analysis of political bots by showing that Twitterbots can be effective at rapidly generating small- to medium-sized cascades; that the retweeted content comprises user-generated hyperpartisan news, which is not strictly fake news, but whose shelf life is remarkably short; and, finally, that a botnet may be organized in specialized tiers or clusters dedicated to replicating either active users or content generated by other bots.

We investigate one potential approach: having social media platform algorithms preferentially display content from news sources that users rate as trustworthy. To do so, we ask whether crowdsourced trust ratings can effectively differentiate more versus less reliable sources. We ran two preregistered experiments (n = 1,010 from Mechanical Turk and n = 970 from Lucid) where individuals rated familiarity with, and trust in, 60 news sources from three categories: (i) mainstream media outlets, (ii) hyperpartisan websites, and (iii) websites that produce blatantly false content (â€œfake newsâ€). Despite substantial partisan differences, we find that laypeople across the political spectrum rated mainstream sources as far more trustworthy than either hyperpartisan or fake news sources. Although this difference was larger for Democrats than Republicans-mostly due to distrust of mainstream sources by Republicans-every mainstream source (with one exception) was rated as more trustworthy than every hyperpartisan or fake news source across both studies when equally weighting ratings of Democrats and Republicans. Furthermore, politically balanced layperson ratings were strongly correlated (r = 0.90) with ratings provided by professional fact-checkers. We also found that, particularly among liberals, individuals higher in cognitive reflection were better able to discern between low- and high-quality sources. Finally, we found that excluding ratings from participants who were not familiar with a given news source dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the crowd. Our findings indicate that having algorithms up-rank content from trusted media outlets may be a promising approach for fighting the spread of misinformation on social media.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Copyright National Academy of Sciences Feb 12, 2019; PMID: 28935; PCID: PQ_28935_Feb122019_116_7____; MSTARLegacyID: VENDIPNA0001897096; PublisherXID: VENDIPNA0001897096; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1806781116 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_pertinent,misinformation",10.1073/pnas.1806781116,Sciences: Comprehensive Works;Judgments;Ratings;Social networks;Algorithms;Familiarity;Websites;News;False information;Ratings & rankings;Trustworthiness;Cognitive ability;Digital media;User generated content,,,07/11/2023

It finds that voters had low levels of knowledge which may have undermined any â€˜status quo biasâ€™; that messengers used by the Remain campaign didnâ€™t work for this audience; that the Remain campaignâ€™s loss-framed figure of &pound;4300 per household per year was judged to be less than the Leave campaignâ€™s figure of &pound;350 m a week (it is six times larger); and that behaviourally-based arguments on immigration might have had an impact.

It has the potential for negative impacts on society and individuals. Therefore, it is significative research on detecting fake news. In the paper, we built a model named SMHA-CNN (Self Multi-Head Attention-based Convolutional Neural Networks) that can judge the authenticity of news with high accuracy based only on content by using convolutional neural networks and self multi-head attention mechanism. In order to prove its validity, we conducted experiments on a public dataset and achieved a precision rate of 95.5% with a recall rate of 95.6% under the 5-fold cross-validation.

In the United States, only Social Security beneficiaries receive inflation-protected guaranteed income. Social Security needs another 1983 compromise in which stakeholders accepted â€œshared painâ€ to avoid insolvency. We propose indexing the benefit using the chained consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers and providing a one-time bonus of 8% to 10% for beneficiaries in their mid-80s, when needs become greater. The chained CPI has little impact when beneficiaries start receiving benefits, but older beneficiaries need protection. The estimated 75-year savings from this restructured benefit amount to 14.2% to 18% of Social Security deficits. Modest increases in payroll taxes and maximum earnings taxed should make up most of the shortfall. Including unearned income with wages and salaries subject to the 6.2% individual tax would produce much more revenue.

The qualitative case study focuses on a digital platform for letters to the editor, operated without editorial curation pre-publication from 2010 to 2018 by one of Denmarkâ€™s largest newspapers, Ekstra Bladet. A discourse analysis of the 50 most shared letters to the editor on Facebook shows that nativist, far-right actors used the platform to disseminate fear-mongering discourses and xenophobic conspiracy theories, disguised as professional news and referred to as articles. These processes took place at the borderline of true and false as well as racist and civil discourse. At this borderline, a lack of supervision and moderation coupled with the openness and visual design of the platform facilitated new forms of covert racism between journalism and user-generated content.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020.

However, OSM are very limited in providing mechanisms to check the credibility of news propagated through their structure. The majority of studies on automatic fake news detection are restricted to English documents, with few works evaluating other languages, and none comparing language-independent characteristics. Moreover, the spreading of deceptive news tends to be a worldwide problem; therefore, this work evaluates textual features that are not tied to a specific language when describing textual data for detecting news. Corpora of news written in American English, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish were explored to study complexity, stylometric, and psychological text features. The extracted features support the detection of fake, legitimate, and satirical news. We compared four machine learning algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)) to induce the detection model. Results show our proposed language-independent features are successful in describing fake, satirical, and legitimate news across three different languages, with an average detection accuracy of 85.3% with RF.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020.

The rumors make it difficult for people to get credible information from Internet and cause social panic. Existing detection methods always rely on a large amount of training data. However, the number of the identified rumors is always insufficient for developing a stable detection model. To handle this problem, we proposed a deep transfer model to achieve accurate rumor detection in social media platforms. In detail, an adaptive parameter tuning method is proposed to solve the negative transferring problem in the parameter transferring process. Experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate rumor detection and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art rumor detection models.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Copyright © 2020 Meicheng Guo et al.

The study shows that the hoaxes about the coronavirus were disseminated mainly on social networks and, among them, especially in closed ones, such as the WhatsApp mobile messaging application. It also detects the most frequent formal and content peculiarities of misinformation. The results reveal that the pandemic, in addition to generating a large number of hoaxes on health and science, also led to the dissemination of many political fake news. The formats, sources and territories of origin of the hoaxes are also explored. Beyond the empirical results, this study makes theoretical contributions in the framework of the emerging studies on information disorders. Specifically, it provides a definition of hoax, as well as a typology in which four main types are identified: joke, exaggeration, decontextualization and deception.

Unexpectedly for many users, automated accounts, known as social bots, contribute more and more to this process of information diffusion. Using Twitter as a benchmark, we consider the traffic exchanged, over one month of observation, on the migration flux from Northern Africa to Italy. We measure the significant traffic of tweets only, by implementing an entropy-based null model that discounts the activity of users and the virality of tweets. Results show that social bots play a central role in the exchange of significant content. Indeed, not only the strongest hubs have a number of bots among their followers higher than expected, but furthermore a group of them, that can be assigned to the same political tendency, share a common set of bots as followers. The retweeting activity of such automated accounts amplifies the hubsâ€™ messages.Twitter is becoming increasingly influential in the global political panorama. Here, the authors take a complex networks approach to study the Twitter debate around the Italian migrant crisis, finding evidence for ""bots squadsâ€ amplifying the tweets of a few key political figures.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2020.

However, the need for extensive collection of data on violations against journalists raises a number of methodological challenges. Our research shows the following issues must be addressed: the lack of conceptual consistency; the lack of methodological transparency; the need for sophisticated data categorisation and disaggregation to enable data to be merged from different sources; the need to establish links to understand causal and temporal relations between people and events; and the need to explore and utilize previously untapped data sources. If we are to strengthen the monitoring of SDG 16.10.1, we propose to develop a robust and reliable events-based methodology and a set of tools which can facilitate the monitoring of the full range of proposed 16.10.1 categories of violations, reconcile data from multiple sources in order to adhere to the established 16.10.1 category definitions, and to further disaggregate the proposed 16.10.1 categories to provide more in-depth information on each instance of a violations. This, we argue, will ultimately contribute towards better understanding of the contextual circumstances and processes producing aggressions against journalists.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020.

Previous research had identified several of these new phenomena: political polarisation, hate speech discourses, and fake news, among others. However, little attention has been paid to the usersâ€™ geographical location, specifically to the role location plays in political discussion on social media, and to its further implications in the digital public sphere. A priori, we might think that on the digital landscape geographical restrictions no longer condition political debate, allowing increasingly diverse users to participate in, and influence, the discussion. To analyse this, machine learning techniques were used to study Twitterâ€™s political conversation about the negotiation process for the formation of the government in Spain that took place between 2015 and 2016. A big data sample of 127,3 million tweets associated with three Spanish cities (Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia) was used. The results show that the geographical location of the users directly affects the political conversation on Twitter, despite the dissolution of the physical restrictions that the online environment favours. Demographics, cultural factors, and proximity to the centres of political power are factors conditioning the structure of digital political debate. These findings are a novel contribution to the design of more effective political campaigns and strategies, and provide a better understanding of the dynamics of the digital public sphere provided by Twitter.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020.

The existing scholarship so far focuses primarily on the role of content and social media distribution and pays little attention to the audiences of right-wing alternative media, especially at a cross-national level and in the European context. The present paper addresses this gap by exploring the characteristics of the audiences of right-wing alternative online media. Based on a secondary data analysis of the 2019 Reuters Digital News Survey, this article presents a cross-national analysis of right-wing alternative media use in Northern and Central Europe. The results indicate a comparatively high prevalence of right-wing alternative online media in Sweden, whereas in Germany, Austria, and Finland, these news websites seem to be far less popular. With regard to audience characteristics, the strongest predictors of right-wing alternative online media use are political interest and a critical stance towards immigration, accompanied by a skeptical assessment of news quality, in general, and distrust, especially in public service broadcasting media. Additionally, the use of social media as a primary news source increases the likelihood of right-wing alternative news consumption. This corroborates the high relevance of social media platforms as distributors and multipliers of right-wing alternative news content. The findings suggest that right-wing alternative online media should not be underestimated as a peripheral phenomenon, but rather have to be considered influential factors for center-right to radical right-leaning politics and audiences in public discourse, with a high mobilizing and polarizing potential.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020.

With rates near the effective lower bound, conventional policy tools struggle to meaningfully raise inflation and inflation expectations, a serious breach of half of the Fed's statutory mandate. Whaťs more, recent research reveals the difficulty in understanding the process that generates upside inflation pressure (Yellen 2019). Even the ""workhorse"" Phillips curve linking unemployment and wages struggles to explain low consumer price inflation. Absent a coherent and effective model to generate higher inflation, communication is harder still.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020.

Politicians and candidates have been forced to adapt to a constantly changing environment, where the rules of one-way communication are lost, but the technical possibilities and scope of the messages are multiplied. This article makes an approach to the tools and practices of technopolitics as well as the tactical and strategic use of digital tools for organization, communication and action. To this end, it highlights the main platforms linked to the Internet such as websites, social networks, instant messaging platforms, and more recently, smartphone applications for political use alone. It also analyses the current trends linked to the celebrification of the candidate, the use of memes, hashtags as a vertebral and transversal element in digital communication, the analysis of big data as the last frontier and the participation through (semi-)automated users or bots. From the point of view of communicative noise, two of the main problems of political communication are addressed, namely astroturfing - in all its variants - and fake news, linked to the increasing hate speech on digital platforms. Finally, after the analysis was carried out, the keys to understanding the politics to come, in the opinion of the authors, are proposed.Alternate abstract:La irrupciÃ³n de internet ha obligado a una reformulaciÃ³n de la comunicaciÃ³n en todos los Ã¡mbitos y a todos los niveles.

Much of the spread of disinformation can thus be attributed to human action. Four studies (total N = 2,634) explored the effect of message attributes (authoritativeness of source, consensus indicators), viewer characteristics (digital literacy, personality, and demographic variables) and their interaction (consistency between message and recipient beliefs) on self-reported likelihood of spreading examples of disinformation. Participants also reported whether they had shared real-world disinformation in the past. Reported likelihood of sharing was not influenced by authoritativeness of the source of the material, nor indicators of how many other people had previously engaged with it. Participantsâ€™ level of digital literacy had little effect on their responses. The people reporting the greatest likelihood of sharing disinformation were those who thought it likely to be true, or who had pre-existing attitudes consistent with it. They were likely to have previous familiarity with the materials. Across the four studies, personality (lower Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, higher Extraversion and Neuroticism) and demographic variables (male gender, lower age and lower education) were weakly and inconsistently associated with self-reported likelihood of sharing. These findings have implications for strategies more or less likely to work in countering disinformation in social media.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020 Tom Buchanan.

The bot classifier ""Botometer"" was successfully introduced as a way to estimate the number of bots in a given list of accounts and, as a consequence, has been frequently used in academic publications. Given its relevance for academic research and our understanding of the presence of automated accounts in any given Twitter discourse, we are interested in Botometerâ€™s diagnostic ability over time. To do so, we collected the Botometer scores for five datasets (three verified as bots, two verified as human; n = 4,134) in two languages (English/German) over three months. We show that the Botometer scores are imprecise when it comes to estimating bots; especially in a different language. We further show in an analysis of Botometer scores over time that Botometer's thresholds, even when used very conservatively, are prone to variance, which, in turn, will lead to false negatives (i.e., bots being classified as humans) and false positives (i.e., humans being classified as bots). This has immediate consequences for academic research as most studies in social science using the tool will unknowingly count a high number of human users as bots and vice versa. We conclude our study with a discussion about how computational social scientists should evaluate machine learning systems that are developed for identifying bots.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020 Rauchfleisch, Kaiser.

Preliminary evidence suggests that the party affiliation of a state's Governor was the most important factor shaping the nature and timing of the response. In particular, we find that Republican Governors were less likely than their Democratic counterparts to issue stay‐at‐home orders and, when they did issue them, were slower to do so. This finding is consistent with a recent trend in U.S. health policy toward vertical partisan coalitions in which state leaders align their policies with national party leaders even when those decisions may not be in the best interest of their states or supported by a majority of their constituents. In this case, however, since President Trump's response to the outbreak has been inconsistent, many Republican Governors appear to be aligning their COVID‐19 responses with the national party's perceived rhetorical and electoral enhancing goals of personal freedom and economic growth/recovery, rather than with President.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020.

While existing studies of fake news focus on theoretical modeling of propagation or identification methods based on machine learning, it is important to understand the realistic propagation mechanisms between theoretical models and black-box methods. Here we track large databases of fake news and real news in both, Weibo in China and Twitter in Japan from different cultures, which include their traces of re-postings. We find in both online social networks that fake news spreads distinctively from real news even at early stages of propagation, e.g. five hours after the first re-postings. Our finding demonstrates collective structural signals that help to understand the different propagation evolution of fake news and real news. Different from earlier studies, identifying the topological properties of the information propagation at early stages may offer novel features for early detection of fake news in social media.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2020.

Only very recently has the question of â€œdemocratic backslidingâ€ attracted any research attention. We argue that democratic instability is best understood with tools from complexity science. The explanatory power of complexity science arises from several features of complex systems. Their relevance in the context of democracy is discussed.

Misinformation ecosystems are interconnected chains of false or misleading reports that become real in their consequences. Misinformation ecosystems are discourse communities that emerged as side effects of affective and linguistic capitalism in contemporary society. Therefore, the performative character of mutually reinforcing false reports explains the social and political impact of fake news. By exploring the manifestation of fake news in Romania, the data analysis reveals a typology of deceptive content circulated in online environments. The typology includes five analytical categories of fake news that constitutes misinformation ecosystems: ""recurrent occurrences"", ""scapegoat offensives"", ""pseudoscientific gaze"", ""combo strikes"", and ""humorous hijacks"". Empirical evidence supports measures against fake news that should address the social validation processes at the level of media or intermedia networks.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020.

Increasingly, such processes take place on social media like Facebook, where media outlets and politicians alike utilize seek promote their respective agenda. Given the recent rise of so-called hyperpartisan media—often described as purveyors of â€œfake newsâ€—and populist right-wing parties across a series of western contexts, this study details the degree to which these novel actors succeed in overtaking their more mainstream or indeed established competitors when it comes to audience engagement on the mentioned platform. Focusing on the one-month period leading up to the 2018 Swedish national elections, the study finds that right-wing actors across the media and the political sector are more successful in engaging their Facebook followers than their competitors. As audience engagement is a key factor for social media success, the study closes by providing a discussion on the repercussions for professionals within the media and the political sector.

However, it has become a primary platform for spreading disinformation with severe societal implications. Automatically identifying social media users that are likely to propagate posts from handles of unreliable news sources sometime in the future is of utmost importance for early detection and prevention of disinformation diffusion in a network, and has yet to be explored. To that end, we present a novel task for predicting whether a user will repost content from Twitter handles of unreliable news sources by leveraging linguistic information from the userâ€™s own posts. We develop a new dataset of approximately 6.2K Twitter users mapped into two categories: (1) those that have reposted content from unreliable news sources; and (2) those that repost content only from reliable sources. For our task, we evaluate a battery of supervised machine learning models as well as state-of-the-art neural models, achieving up to 79.7 macro F1. In addition, our linguistic feature analysis uncovers differences in language use and style between the two user categories.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020 Mu and Aletras.

Quantitative data from the Digital News Report (2018 and 2019), based on a survey of more than 2000 digital users from each country was used for the analysis. Results show remarkable similarities among the three countries, and how digital users identically ranked the types of problematic information that concerned them most. Survey participants were most concerned by stories where facts are spun or twisted to push a particular agenda, followed by, those that are completely made up for political or commercial reasons, and finally, they were least concerned by poor journalism (factual mistakes, dumbed-down stories, misleading headlines/clickbait). A general index of â€œConcern about disinformationâ€ was constructed using several sociodemographic variables that might influence the perception. It showed that the phenomenon is higher among women, older users, those particularly interested in political news, and among left-wingers. Several measures are employed by users to avoid disinformation, such as checking a number of different sources to see whether a news story is reported in the same way, relying on the reputation of the news company, and/or deciding not to share a news story due to doubts regarding its accuracy. This article concludes that the perceived relevance of different types of problematic information, and preventive actions, are not homogeneous among different population segments.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021.

Despite some significant efforts to determine the effects of misinformation, the results are so far inconclusive. Previous research has sought to analyze how the public perceive the effects of disinformation. This article is set in this context, and its main objective is to investigate usersâ€™ perception of fake news, as well as identify the criteria on which their recognition strategies are based. The research pays particular attention to determining whether there are gender differences in the concern about the effects of fake news, the degree of difficulty in detecting fake news and the most common topics it covers. The results are based on the analysis of a representative survey of the Spanish population (N = 1,001) where participants were asked about their relationship with fake news and their competence in determining the veracity of the information, and their ability to identify false content were assessed. The findings show that men and womenâ€™s perception of difficulty in identifying fake news is similar, while women are more concerned than men about the pernicious effects of misinformation on society. Gender differences are also found in the topics of the false information received. A greater proportion of men receive false news on political issues, while women tend to more frequently receive fake news about celebrities.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021.

Yet, a wide range of motivations for sharing misinformation might impact its spread, as well as peopleâ€™s belief of it. By examining research on motivations for sharing news information generally, and misinformation specifically, we derive a range of motivations that broaden current understandings of the sharing of misinformation to include factors that may to some extent mitigate the presumed dangers of misinformation for society. To illustrate the utility of our viewpoint we report data from a preliminary study of peopleâ€™s dis/belief reactions to misinformation shared on social media using natural language processing. Analyses of over 2,5 million comments demonstrate that misinformation on social media is often disbelieved. These insights are leveraged to propose directions for future research that incorporate a more inclusive understanding of the various motivations and strategies for sharing misinformation socially in large-scale online networks.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021.

However, there is a lack of understanding of how the emergence of new players has modified the logic and rhythm of the media production chain. In this article, we try to identify a theoretical approach to analyze and classify the different roles and actors considered to be disrupting the media stage. Through a systematic literature review of more than 200 articles published in the last twenty years, we identify and define a term to better understand the nature of these new media players: digital intermediaries.

Basel","Stereotype is a type of social bias massively present in texts that computational models use. There are stereotypes that present special difficulties because they do not rely on personal attributes. This is the case of stereotypes about immigrants, a social category that is a preferred target of hate speech and discrimination. We propose a new approach to detect stereotypes about immigrants in texts focusing not on the personal attributes assigned to the minority but in the frames, that is, the narrative scenarios, in which the group is placed in public speeches. We have proposed a fine-grained social psychology grounded taxonomy with six categories to capture the different dimensions of the stereotype (positive vs. negative) and annotated a novel StereoImmigrants dataset with sentences that Spanish politicians have stated in the Congress of Deputies. We aggregate these categories in two supracategories: one is Victims that expresses the positive stereotypes about immigrants and the other is Threat that expresses the negative stereotype. We carried out two preliminary experiments: first, to evaluate the automatic detection of stereotypes; and second, to distinguish between the two supracategories of immigrantsâ€™ stereotypes. In these experiments, we employed state-of-the-art transformer models (monolingual and multilingual) and four classical machine learning classifiers. We achieve above 0.83 of accuracy with the BETO model in both experiments, showing that transformers can capture stereotypes about immigrants with a high level of accuracy.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

Methodology: An exploratory sample was used (N = 712), whose participants were exposed to 20 politically biased headlines (pro-right and pro-left): half fake news and the other half true news. Participants evaluated their credibility and willingness to share them on social media. Results: Right-wing supporters are more likely to create and share compatible fake news. This trend was verified in all the measurement parameters of partisanship ((1) voting intention, (2) partisan sympathy and (3) self-placement on the I-D scale), in contrast to what was revealed with left-wing partisans. Discussion and conclusions: Only right-wing supporters show a tendency to believe more in fake news that favors their orientation. The same is not the case with left-wing individuals. However, both right-wing and left-wing supporters are more likely to share biased content. We believe that people with a right-wing party identity may be more exposed to disinformation in Portugal, as most disinformation sites seek this specific audience.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021.

On the one hand it seems to be thriving, in that the range of media objects that were previously studied under the rubric of popular culture has certainly expanded. Yet, cultural studies scholars rarely study these media objects as popular culture. Instead, concerns about immaterial labor, about the manipulation of voting behavior and public opinion, about filter bubbles and societal polarization, and about populist authoritarianism, determine the dominant frames with which the contemporary media environment is approached. This article aims to trace how this change has come to pass over the last 50 years. It argues that changes in the media environment are important, but also that cultural studies as an institutionalizing interdisciplinary project has changed. It identifies â€œthe moment of popular cultureâ€ as a relatively short-lived but epoch-defining moment in cultural studies. This moment was subsequently displaced by a set of related yet different theoretical problematics that gradually moved the study of popular culture away from the popular. These displacements are: the hollowing out of the notion of the popular, as signaled early on by Meaghan Morrisâ€™ article â€œThe Banality of Cultural Studiesâ€ in 1988; the institutionalization of cultural studies; the rise of the governmentality approach and a growing engagement with affect theory.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021.

We deploy neutral social bots who start following different news sources on Twitter, and track them to probe distinct biases emerging from platform mechanisms versus user interactions. We find no strong or consistent evidence of political bias in the news feed. Despite this, the news and information to which U.S. Twitter users are exposed depend strongly on the political leaning of their early connections. The interactions of conservative accounts are skewed toward the right, whereas liberal accounts are exposed to moderate content shifting their experience toward the political center. Partisan accounts, especially conservative ones, tend to receive more followers and follow more automated accounts. Conservative accounts also find themselves in denser communities and are exposed to more low-credibility content.Social media platforms moderating misinformation have been accused of political bias. Here, the authors use neutral social bots to show that, while there is no strong evidence for such a bias, the content to which Twitter users are exposed depends strongly on the political leaning of early Twitter connections.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2021. corrected publication 2022.

This research takes as a case study the coverage given by the Spanish digital media to a hoax broadcast during the Filomena storm in 2021 that insisted that the snow was plastic. The purpose of this work is to analyze the instrumentalization of fake information as an expression of the information media crisis in the current context of disinformation. We set out four specific objectives: (SO1) to study the spread of the hoax through the media, (SO2) to analyze the construction of headlines in the news pieces, (SO3) to investigate the treatment of the hoax in the content of the pieces, and (SO4) to analyze the sources used in the pieces. To reflect on this phenomenon, we propose a three-dimensional model (structural, economic, and pragmatic) aimed at clarifying the relationship between the logic of the spread of hoaxes on the Internet and the role played by traditional media in their diffusion. The methodology used combines workflow techniques of digital methods with quantitative and content analyses. The results reveal the appropriation of certain communication strategies by digital newspapers aimed at obtaining visits. We conclude that the Spanish media, by adapting to the dynamics of disinformation irresponsibly encouraged by the attention economy, subscribe to and reinforce the crisis of credibility faced by the media ecosystem.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Copyright El Profesional de la Informacion 2021; MSTARLegacyID: ICAELCO_ELPI_v30n4_20210101_86394; PublisherXID: ICAELCO_ELPI_v30n4_20210101_86394; PCID: MSTAR_2035519_2021_30_4___Interacciónyvisualización_; DOI: 10.3145/epi.2021.jul.12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_pertinent",10.3145/epi.2021.jul.12,Library And Information Sciences;Computer Applications;Media crisis;Disinformation;Hoaxes;Denialists;Attention economics;News coverage;Science;Social networks;Social media;Three-dimensional study model;Three dimensional study model;Electronic newspapers;False information;Case studies;Newspapers,,,08/11/2023

We do not yet know if theology shaped the resistance or if it was more a product of a polarized national political context. We argue that the country context likely shapes how conservative Protestantsâ€™ moral worldview affects their perceptions of the pandemic and government restrictions. Countries implementing more regulations, those with limited access to healthcare, food, and other essential services, and those with past histories of epidemics may all shape residentsâ€™ perceptions. Drawing on the case of American Amish and Mennonite missionaries stationed abroad, we content-analyzed accounts of the pandemic from an international Amish and Mennonite correspondence newspaper. We found that the missionariesâ€™ perceptions of the pandemic and governmental restrictions differ from those of their U.S. counterparts, which suggests that context likely shapes how religious moral worldviews express themselves concerning public health interventions.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

Social Media has emerged as the most readily accessible and fastest platform for updates related to events happening worldwide. The increase in the use of social media has also increased the misuse of resources for spreading unverified information generally termed as a rumour. The biggest problem in social media is the speed at which the information spreads without verifying its credibility. There has been lot of research for detection and prevention of rumours over social media. This paper focuses on presenting the present state of the art in automatic rumour detection in social networks. The paper highlights the prominent researches done in detecting these rumours in social network over the last 5 years. This paper shows both manual and automatic approaches that can be used. Also various tools have been identified which were developed for rumour detection in social media platforms. This paper shows the different available approaches that are being used and can be used in future with improvement.,"Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021.

Current research on the topic focused on the detection of fake news in a particular context or event (such as elections) or using data from a short period of time. Therefore, an evaluation of the current proposals in a long-term scenario where the topics discussed may change is lacking. In this work, we deviate from current approaches to the problem and instead focus on a longitudinal evaluation using social network publications spanning an 18-month period. We evaluate different combinations of features and supervised models in a long-term scenario where the training and testing data are ordered chronologically, and thus the robustness and stability of the models can be evaluated through time. We experimented with 3 different scenarios where the models are trained with 15-, 30-, and 60-day data periods. The results show that detection models trained with word-embedding features are the ones that perform better and are less likely to be affected by the change of topics (for example, the rise of COVID-19 conspiracy theories). Furthermore, the additional days of training data also increase the performance of the best feature/model combinations, although not very significantly (around 2%). The results presented in this paper build the foundations towards a more pragmatic approach to the evaluation of fake news detection models in social networks.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

We considered perceived likelihood that the pandemic would lead to civil unrest, perceived importance of taking precautions to prevent transmission and perceptions that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated.MethodsData were collected from 5 to 12 April 2020, shortly after Texasâ€™ stay-at-home declaration. We generated a sample using random digit dial methods for a telephone survey (n=77, response rate=8%) and by randomly selecting adults from an ongoing panel to complete the survey online (n=1120, non-probability sample). We conducted a logistic regression to estimate differences in perceptions by gun ownership. To account for bias associated with use of a non-probability sample, we used Bayesian data integration and ran linear regression models to produce more accurate measures of association.ResultsAmong the 60% of Texas adults who reported gun ownership, estimates of past 7-day gun purchases, ammunition purchases and gun carrying were 15% (n=78), 20% (n=100) and 24% (n=130), respectively. We found no evidence of an association between gun ownership with perceived importance of taking precautions to prevent transmission or with perceived likelihood of civil unrest. Results from the logistic regression (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63) and the linear regression (&beta;=0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.29) suggest that gun owners may be more likely to believe the threat of COVID-19 was exaggerated.ConclusionsCompared with those without guns, gun owners may have been inclined to downplay the threat of COVID-19 early in the pandemic.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

As a result, EKRE has grown into a full-fledged mass party type of organisation with all the characteristics associated to it. Furthermore, it has become the fastest-growing party in Estonia in terms of membership and been notably successful in electoral terms. This article focuses primarily on the question of how EKRE developed a mass party organisation with a strong, ideologically-devoted activist core and a remarkable presence on the ground. The article also demonstrates how the party offers a variety of opportunities for engagement to its members. In contrast to an archetypical right-wing populist party, the decision-making power is somewhat diffused within the party, though the party leader remains the public face and mouthpiece of the party. EKREâ€™s online engagement strategies have been among the most successful in recent Estonian politics and make the party stand out. The article demonstrates that parties can often revise as well as repurpose the features of the predecessor parties and even build defunct mainstream parties into mass parties with a firm ideological core.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021.

The intentional misleading of fake news makes the automatic detection of fake news an important and challenging problem, which has not been well understood at present. Meanwhile, fake news can contain true evidence imitating the true news and present different degrees of falsity, which further aggravates the difficulty of detection. On the other hand, the fake news speaker himself provides rich social behavior information, which provides unprecedented opportunities for advanced fake news detection. In this study, we propose a new hybrid deep model based on behavior information (HMBI), which uses the social behavior information of the speaker to detect fake news more accurately. Specifically, we model news content and social behavior information simultaneously to detect the degrees of falsity of news. The experimental analysis on real-world data shows that the detection accuracy of HMBI is increased by 10.41% on average, which is the highest of the existing model. The detection accuracy of fake news exceeds 50% for the first time.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Copyright © 2021 Jian Xing et al.

However, the perception ot fake news or social media has resulted in poor decision-making and anxiety among smart city residents. Recognizing the importance ot filtering false information for the smart city population, this research proposed a policy and platform for filtering false information to be presented to the citizens of Sisaket Smart City. Thailand; this was to ensure the efficient and secure use ot large amounts ot citizens' information, as well as information exchange between agencies. Additionally, the study was designed to kick-start the use ot information in a smart city to make it more efficient and capable ot filtering out material that could have harmful consequences or fike news. Recognizing its significance, the researchers proposed building regulations and platforms for detecting and filtering fake news in smart cities using artificial intelligence and blockchain technology'. The findings indicated that urban inhabitants who moved into Thailand's smart cities, such as Sisaket, were highly receptive to the employment ot rules and platforms to filter fake news.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021.

Misinformation that gets attention and is drawn out longer during and after such disasters potentially puts the affected population at additional risk. This research focuses on popular but ambiguous and contentious narratives transmitted via Twitter during Hurricane Harvey. Two most talked about contentious narratives consisted of (1) government agencies putting undocumented immigrants at risk and (2) decisions about evacuation. They depict the process of debunking, competing narratives, and political ideology that have kept the stories alive. Our findings suggest the following: that government and reporters play important roles in stemming the spread of contentious or false information; ambiguous and contentious narratives remain in the conversation longer, specific debunking works faster and reaches a larger audience than general or confused debunking; and the lack of coordination of messaging online and on the ground as well as among different government agencies may threaten the timely and accurate delivery of disaster responses.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © Springer Nature B.V. 2020.; DOI: 10.1007/s11069-020-04430-w; PMID: 108532; PCID: PQ_108532_Feb2021_105_3_; MSTARLegacyID: SPVLNTHZ11069443020210201 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_pertinent",10.1007/s11069-020-04430-w,Earth Sciences;Social Media;Disaster management;Hurricane Harvey;Misinformation;Hurricanes;Natural disasters;Immigrants;Supports;Undocumented immigrants;Disasters;Government agencies;Decision making;Digital media;Narratives;Credibility;Verbal communication;Politics;Social networks;Gossip;False information,,,08/11/2023

We surveyed a representative sample of adults living in the United States to investigate the relationships among hyperpartisan news use, partisanship, and cognitive and affective involvement. First, we find that strong partisanship—from both Democrats and Republicans—relates to exposure to both left- and right-leaning hyperpartisan news. Second, exposure to left-leaning hyperpartisan content relates to negative affective involvement, while exposure to right-leaning hyperpartisan news relates to positive affective involvement. Neither left- nor right-leaning hyperpartisan news use relates to cognitive involvement, though traditional news use does. These findings add to the literature on partisan selective exposure and provide new details about the makeup of news audiences and their cognitive and affective involvement with hyperpartisan news.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2020 Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication; DOI: 10.1080/15205436.2020.1844902; PMID: 67679; PCID: PQ_67679_Mar20212; MSTARLegacyID: TYFRMCSY202103011844902 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not dl/ml,other_methodology",10.1080/15205436.2020.1844902,Sociology;News;Cognition;Participation;Partisanship;Exposure;Selectivity;Political parties,,,08/11/2023

And as was true on the national political stage, environmental issues in North Carolina often split the legislature down the aisle. So as the new Republican majority began to develop environmental policy initiatives for issues including coastal management, domestic energy (e.g., offshore exploration and production, onshore shale gas, and coal ash), and broad regulatory reform, to name just a few, the agenda for holding environmental science hostage to hyperpartisan rancor was fully developed. And then, a miracle happened. In 2016, the Republican-led General Assembly authorized the creation of the North Carolina Policy Collaboratory. The initiative was spearheaded by Senate leader Phil Berger, in response to public suggestions that the expertise within the University of North Carolina System should be called on to help address state and local policy challenges.

These were disputes for the hegemonic narrative between two stories based on opposed hashtags: one based on news from mainstream media and the other, based on disinformation, mostly from hyperpartisan outlets. Our goal was to understand how hyperpartisan outlets created and shaped these discursive struggles and the strategies used to spread disinformation to create an â€œalternative narrativeâ€ to the facts. Our case study is focused on two discursive struggles, for which we will use critical discourse analysis and social network analysis. Our findings suggest that (1) the structure of the hashtag wars was very polarized and right-wing groups had higher exposure to hyperpartisan content and disinformation, while traditional media discourse circulates more among other different ideological clusters; (2) right-wing hyperpartisan media mostly used biased framing and polarized ideological discourse structure as manipulative strategies to reframe the events and create a counter-narrative (and thus, to create the dispute); and (3) opinion leaders were major spreaders of disinformation among far-right users, as they reinforced hyperpartisan content and became key actors in the discursive struggles (and thus, reinforced the dispute).","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2021.

Treating an accountâ€™s social media following as both an ego network and an audience critical for information diffusion and influence accrual, we situate IRA Twitter accountsâ€™ accumulation of followers in the ideologically polarized, attention driven, and asymmetric political communication system. Results show that partisan enclaves on Twitter contributed to IRA accountsâ€™ followings through retweeting; and that mainstream and hyperpartisan media assisted conservative IRA accountsâ€™ following gain by embedding their tweets in news. These results illustrate how network dynamics within social media and news media amplification beyond it together boosted social media followings. Our results also highlight the dynamics fanning the flames of disinformation: partisan polarization, media fragmentation and asymmetry, and an attention economy optimized for engagement rather than accuracy.

Due to the easy access, low cost, and faster reach of the information, people search out and devour news from online social networks. In contrast, the increasing acceptance of social media reporting leads to the spread of fake news. This is a minacious problem that causes disputes and endangers the societal stability and harmony. Fake news spread has gained attention from researchers due to its vicious nature. proliferation of misinformation in all media, from the internet to cable news, paid advertising and local news outlets, has made it essential for people to identify the misinformation and sort through the facts. Researchers are trying to analyze the credibility of information and curtail false information on such platforms. Credibility is the believability of the piece of information at hand. Analyzing the credibility of fake news is challenging due to the intent of its creation and the polychromatic nature of the news. In this work, we propose a model for detecting fake news. Our method investigates the content of the news at the early stage i.e., when the news is published but is yet to be disseminated through social media. Our work interprets the content with automatic feature extraction and the relevance of the text pieces. In summary, we introduce stance as one of the features along with the content of the article and employ the pre-trained contextualized word embeddings BERT to obtain the state-of-art results for fake news detection. The experiment conducted on the real-world dataset indicates that our model outperforms the previous work and enables fake news detection with an accuracy of 95.32%.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021 Karande et al.

Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation5-7. Here, we attempt to address both ofthese questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy-and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy8,9, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Copyright Nature Publishing Group Apr 22, 2021; PMID: 28221; PCID: PQ_28221_Apr222021_592_7855____; MSTARLegacyID: VENDGNAA0002722541; PublisherXID: VENDGNAA0002722541; DOI: 10.1038/s41586-021-03344-2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not_pertinent",10.1038/s41586-021-03344-2,Environmental Studies;News;Preferences;Accuracy;Computer applications;False information;Confidence intervals;Partisanship;Dissociation;Social networks;United States;US,,,08/11/2023

This paper analyzes the Twitter vaccine-related information environment by focusing on the information sources shared by about 500,000 tweets published within three years - 18 months before and after the promulgation of the Law 119/2017 on mandatory vaccinations - highlighting clusters of sources shared by the users and changes in problematic and quality information throughout that period. Results show that the politicization of the topic was associated with the growing spread of problematic information. They expose the vaccine-related information environment as characterized by an homophilic and polarized structure grouping together and opposing, on the one hand, anti-vaccination, blacklisted sources, alternative therapy and conspiracy websites, and on the other, scientific and health sources, revealing that despite the new initiatives aimed at increasing quality information and fighting problematic information online, there was a lack of scientific information both during and after the debate on the vaccinations law, while problematic information appears to have increased in volume over the years.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021.

Their reach and influence in the contemporary digital media ecology have been widely highlighted, yet there has been little scholarship to situate these important new players in the field of political communication. This article argues that, first, these â€˜interlopersâ€™ known as the â€˜alt-rightâ€™ and â€˜alt-leftâ€™ need to be understood as embedded in the context of populist politics. Second, â€˜hyperpartisanâ€™ describes these sites better than the framework of alternative media as it mirrors populismâ€™s ideological pillar of â€˜usâ€™ versus â€˜themâ€™. Finally, a deliberate provocation is argued to name these digital start-ups as news to create a starting point for conceptualising these disruptive new media forces.

The results show that the most commonly used formats were image and video, that disinformation was most often based on taking information out of context and deception, and that the source could not be identified. The most shared characteristics associated otherness with receiving aid, violence and illegal immigration. The most commonly used images were photographs, which mostly showed people in a general manner (not individually). Despite this, disinformation was not generated by manipulating images, but by inserting text over images. The use of supposed screenshots to create fictitious references or take truthful screenshots out of context was also notable.Alternate abstract:Este trabajo estudia la construcciÃ³n de la imagen de la otredad a travÃ©s de la desinformaciÃ³n en Internet.

We investigated whether subscribers to a fact checking newsletter (n = 1397) were willing to share possible misinformation, and whether predictors of possible misinformation sharing are the same as for general samples. We also investigated predictors of willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccine and found that although vaccine acceptance was high on average, it decreased as a function of lower belief in science and higher conspiracy mentality. We found that 24% of participants had shared possible misinformation and that this was predicted by a lower belief in science. Like general samples, our participants were typically motivated to share possible misinformation due to interest in the information, or to seek a second opinion about claim veracity. However, even if information is shared in good faith and not for the purpose of deceiving or misleading others, the spread of misinformation is nevertheless highly problematic. Exposure to misinformation engenders faulty beliefs in others and undermines efforts to curtail the spread of COVID-19 by reducing adherence to social distancing measures and increasing vaccine hesitancy.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021 Saling et al.

The study culminates in a critical interpretation of results and discussion of the phenomenon in its Polish and international contexts.

While many warnings about political misinformation are valid and enable people to reject misleading information, the quality and validity of misinformation warnings can vary widely. Replicating and extending research from the fields of social cognition and forensic psychology, we find evidence that valid retrospective warnings of misleading news can help individuals discard erroneous information, although the corrections are weak. However, when informative news is wrongly labeled as inaccurate, these false warnings reduce the newsâ€™ credibility. Invalid misinformation warnings taint the truth, lead individuals to discard authentic information, and impede political memory. As only a few studies on the tainted truth effect exist, our research helps to illuminate the less explored dark side of misinformation warnings. Our findings suggest general warnings of misinformation should be avoided as indiscriminate use can reduce the credibility of valid news sources and lead individuals to discard useful information.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2020.

As fake news impacts credibility, it affects the general public, policymakers, decision-makers, and the journalistic environment. However, current research on fake news using content-based approaches focuses majorly on one or two dimensions of stylometrics, semantic and linguistic processes, but not on these three simultaneously. Considering that content-based detection of fake news would benefit from a multidimensional approach because of their inherent characteristics, we proposed a method that uses all of these dimensions to improve classification accuracy, using a voting ensemble designed in an ensemble classifier form. The results show that the multidimensional voting classifier has produced more accurate results than its peers while being more sensitive to distinguish between true and false news when using randomized data.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021 The Author(s).

To mitigate this research gap, we present a comprehensive survey of fake news research, conducted in the fields of computer and social sciences, through the lens of news creation and consumption with internal and external factors. Methods We collect 2,277 fake news-related literature searching six primary publishers (ACM, IEEE, arXiv, APA, ELSEVIER, and Wiley) from July to September 2020. These articles are screened according to specific inclusion criteria (see Fig 1). Eligible literature are categorized, and temporal trends of fake news research are examined. Results As a way to acquire more comprehensive understandings of fake news and identify effective countermeasures, our review suggests (1) developing a computational model that considers the characteristics of news consumption environments leveraging insights from social science, (2) understanding the diversity of news consumers through mental models, and (3) increasing consumersâ€™ awareness of the characteristics and impacts of fake news through the support of transparent information access and education. Conclusion We discuss the importance and direction of supporting oneâ€™s â€œdigital media literacyâ€ in various news generation and consumption environments through the convergence of computational and social science research.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Evidence Based Healthcare; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021 Kim et al.

Basel","To alleviate the impact of fake news on our society, predicting the popularity of fake news posts on social media is a crucial problem worthy of study. However, most related studies on fake news emphasize detection only. In this paper, we focus on the issue of fake news influence prediction, i.e., inferring how popular a fake news post might become on social platforms. To achieve our goal, we propose a comprehensive framework, MUFFLE, which captures multi-modal dynamics by encoding the representation of news-related social networks, user characteristics, and content in text. The attention mechanism developed in the model can provide explainability for social or psychological analysis. To examine the effectiveness of MUFFLE, we conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms both state-of-the-art methods of popularity prediction and machine-based baselines in top-k NDCG and hit rate. Through the experiments, we also analyze the feature importance for predicting fake news influence via the explainability provided by MUFFLE.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

They are, however, affected by misinformation and they might be playing a role in the growth of political polarization. In this paper, we create an agent based model to investigate how policing content and backlash on social media (i.e. conflict) can lead to an increase in polarization for both users and news sources. Our model is an advancement over previously proposed models because it allows us to study the polarization of both users and news sources, the evolution of the audience connections between users and sources, and it makes more realistic assumptions about the starting conditions of the system. We find that the tendency of users and sources to avoid policing, backlash and conflict in general can increase polarization online. Specifically polarization comes from the ease of sharing political posts, intolerance for opposing points of view causing backlash and policing, and volatility in changing oneâ€™s opinion when faced with new information. On the other hand, it seems that the integrity of a news source in trying to resist the backlash and policing has little effect.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 Coscia, Rossi.

Basel","During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media served as an important channel for the public to obtain health information and disseminate opinions when offline communication was severely hindered. Yet the emergence of social bots influencing social media conversations about public health threats will require researchers and practitioners to develop new communication strategies considering their influence. So far, little is known as to what extent social bots have been involved in COVID-19 vaccine-related discussions and debates on social media. This work selected a period of nearly 9 months after the approval of the first COVID-19 vaccines to detect social bots and performed high-frequency word analysis for both social bot-generated and human-generated tweets, thus working out the extent to which social bots participated in the discussion on the COVID-19 vaccine on Twitter and their participation features. Then, a textual analysis was performed on the content of tweets. The findings revealed that 8.87% of the users were social bots, with 11% of tweets in the corpus. Besides, social bots remained active over three periods. High-frequency words in the discussions of social bots and human users on vaccine topics were similar within the three peaks of discourse.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

We concentrate on two key concepts—appropriation and authorship—which have a permanent standing in the remix research literature. To support our theoretical analysis, we investigate the coverage of two cases in the Finnish right-wing counter-media online publication MV-lehti. Our findings enable new readings on the nature of both counter-media work and remix culture. In fact, counter-media publishing leans more in the direction of remix culture—which is based on the act of using pre-existing materials to produce something new—than towards traditional journalistic convention, with its rules and ethical guidelines. MV-lehtiâ€™s practice of combining and layering different material is discernibly political, often resembling media activism. Our study provides the argument that counter to the utopian democratising assumptions of remix culture, the proliferation of remix practices has also given antidemocratic actors the means to challenge collectively and institutionally supported ideas of knowledge and justice. Counter-media publishing is perhaps democratising in that it offers the means to participate, but these antagonistic actors also remix news to undermine liberal-democratic ideals and social justice. Evidently, remix practices can be co-opted for a reactionary agenda.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022.

However, such general connection remains elusive. This research seeks to further clarify this strand of the literature by incorporating peopleâ€™s belief that important political information will find them without actively seeking news—""News Finds Meâ€ perception (NFM). For that, we use online survey data from two European countries that differ regarding the ideological political supply side of populism (Italy and Portugal). The main results suggest that citizens who hold stronger populist attitudes will also develop stronger NFM. Furthermore, findings reveal a mediating effect of social media news use on the effects of populist attitudes over NFM. That is, those who hold stronger populist attitudes tend to use social media to get exposed to public affairs news more often, which in turn explains the development of the NFM. These results emphasize the importance of systematically exploring citizens populistsâ€™ attitudes within todayâ€™s social media, social networks, and complex information systems.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022.

This review draws on current literature to build a working definition of fake news focused on its present relevance to journalism and political communication contemporary debate, distinguishing it from non-pertinent conceptual varieties and contributing to a much-needed clarification on the subject. We performed a qualitative analysis of the literature published between 2016 and 2020. Data were extracted from Web of Science and Scopus. We define fake news as a type of online disinformation with misleading and/or false statements that may or may not be associated with real events, intentionally designed to mislead and/or manipulate a specific or imagined public through the appearance of a news format with an opportunistic structure (title, image, content) to attract the readerâ€™s attention in order to obtain more clicks and shares and, therefore, greater advertising revenue and/or ideological gain.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

We assess the replicability and generalizability of this accuracy prompt effect by meta-analyzing 20 experiments (with a total N&thinsp;=&thinsp;26,863) completed by our group between 2017 and 2020. This internal meta-analysis includes all relevant studies regardless of outcome and uses identical analyses across all studies. Overall, accuracy prompts increased the quality of news that people share (sharing discernment) relative to control, primarily by reducing sharing intentions for false headlines by 10% relative to control in these studies. The magnitude of the effect did not significantly differ by content of headlines (politics compared with COVID-19 related news) and did not significantly decay over successive trials. The effect was not robustly moderated by gender, race, political ideology, education, or value explicitly placed on accuracy, but was significantly larger for older, more reflective, and more attentive participants. This internal meta-analysis demonstrates the replicability and generalizability of the accuracy prompt effect on sharing discernment.Prompting people to consider accuracy can improve the quality of news they share online. Here, using an internal meta-analysis, the authors show that this effect is replicable and generalizes across headlines, types of accuracy prompt, and various participant characteristics.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2022.

This content has shown to have the capability to manipulate individualsâ€™ beliefs, voting and activities. It is a demonstrably effective way for foreign adversaries to create domestic strife in open societies. It is also, by virtue of the magnitude of content, very difficult to combat. Solutions ranging from censorship to inaction have been proposed. One solution that has been suggested is labeling content to indicate its accuracy or characteristics. This would provide an indication or even warning regarding content that may be deceptive in nature, helping content consumers make informed decisions. If successful, this approach would avoid limitations on content creatorsâ€™ freedom of speech while also mitigating the problems caused by deceptive content. To determine whether this approach could be effective, this paper presents the results of a national survey aimed at understanding how content labeling impacts online content consumption decision making. To ascertain the impact of potential labeling techniques on different portions of the population, it analyzes labelsâ€™ efficacy in terms of income level, political party affiliation and online usage time. This, thus, facilitates determining whether the labeling may be effective and also aids in understating whether its effectiveness may vary by demographic group.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

Detecting lies is therefore essential and has many possible applications. Our study aims to investigate the performance of automated lie detection methods, namely the most recent breed of pre-trained transformer neural networks capable of processing the Polish language. We used a dataset of nearly 1500 true and false statements, half of which were transcripts and the other half written statements, originating from possibly the largest study of deception in the Polish language. Technically, the problem was posed as text classification. We found that models perform better on typed than spoken utterances. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 0.69, which is much higher than the human performance average of 0.56. For transcribed utterances, human performance was at 0.58 and the models reached 0.62. We also explored model interpretability based on integrated gradient to shed light on classifier decisions. Our observations highlight the role of first words and phrases in model decisions, but more work is needed to systematically explore the observed patterns.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

However, in recent years, they have acquired great prominence on the public agenda, conditioning electoral results and generating episodes of political destabilization. Academic interest runs in parallel with the consideration of disinformation as a growing priority for governments and international organizations, due to its geostrategic relevance and its importance for national sovereignty and security. The interference of countries such as Russia or China in other nationsâ€™ electoral processes, using new tools and methods to manipulate public opinion and proliferate cyberattacks have led to the creation of agencies or regulations aimed at curbing disinformation in some states. The UN, the EU and other countriesâ€™ governments have tried to develop strategies to respond to this growing threat. The pandemic has accelerated the decline of local media, which leaves communities in a state of serious vulnerability. Reliable resources and sources around local information are scarce assets, information is increasingly consumed through social media, and in them disinformation easily proliferates. With this proposal, we intend to start a discussion around disinformation at a local level, something that has been absent in disinformation studies.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

Recent studies have utilized different artificial intelligence technologies to verify the truth of the news and provide explanations for the results, which have shown remarkable success in interpretable fake news detection. However, individualsâ€™ judgments of news are usually hierarchical, prioritizing valuable words above essential sentences, which is neglected by existing fake news detection models. In this paper, we propose an interpretable novel neural network-based model, the hierarchical co-attention selection network (HCSN), to predict whether the source post is fake, as well as an explanation that emphasizes important comments and particular words. The key insight of the HCSN model is to incorporate the Gumbel–Max trick in the hierarchical co-attention selection mechanism that captures sentence-level and word-level information from the source post and comments following the sequence of words–sentences–words–event. In addition, HCSN enjoys the additional benefit of interpretability—it provides a conscious explanation of how it reaches certain results by selecting comments and highlighting words. According to the experiments conducted on real-world datasets, our model outperformed state-of-the-art methods and generated reasonable explanations.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

Many works on stylometry have recently been reported. However, there is a research gap regarding review studies in this field from a bibliometric and evolutionary perspective. Therefore, in this paper, a bibliometric analysis of publications from the Scopus database in the stylometric research field was proposed. Then, research articles published between 1968 and 2021 were collected and analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package for bibliometric analysis via the Biblioshiny web interface. Empirical results were also presented in terms of the performance analysis and the science mapping analysis. From these results, it is concluded that there has been a strong growth in stylometry research in recent years, while the USA, Poland, and the UK are the most productive countries, and this is due to many strong research partnerships. It was also concluded that the research topics of most articles, based on author keywords, focused on two broad thematic categories: (1) the main tasks in stylometry and (2) methodological approaches (statistics and machine learning methods).","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the author.

We examine the range of DANM, especially public Facebook pages, related to two large-scale social movements neighbouring mainland China as case studies of social movement media exerting maximalist effects. The assessment relies on academic sources, archival materials, descriptive social media metrics, and an original analysis of external content shared on public Facebook pages and groups using data collected from the Facebook Graph API. A six-dimensional scheme is proposed to guide the assessment. Sorting through and piecing together multiple sources, we arrive at a multi-faceted description, comparison, and analysis of the impact of DANM during two social movements.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

Democrats estimate that the average Democrat values democratic characteristics 56% (in Study 1) and 77% (in Study 2) more than the average Republican. In a mirror image, Republicans estimate that the average Republican values democratic characteristics 82% (in Study 1) and 88% (in Study 2) more than the average Democrat. In turn, the tendency to believe that political ingroup members value democratic characteristics more than political outgroup members is associated with support for anti-democratic practices, especially among Republicans.

Existing solutions are mainly based on content features or propagation structures for rumor detection. However, due to the variety of strategies in creating rumors, only considering certain features cannot achieve good enough detection results. In addition, existing works only consider the rumor propagation structure and ignore the aggregation structures of rumors, which cannot provide enough discriminative features (especially in the early days of rumors, when the structure of the propagation is incomplete). To solve these problems, this paper proposes a rumor detection method with multimodal feature fusion and enhances the feature representation of the rumor propagation network by adding aggregation features. More specifically, we built a graph model of the propagation structure as well as the aggregation structure. Next, by utilizing the BERT pre-training model and the bidirectional graph convolutional network, we captured the features of text content, propagation structure, and aggregation structure, respectively. Finally, the multimodal features were aggregated based on the attention mechanism, and the final result was obtained through the MLP classifier. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

We fine-tuned BERT to codify claims and pieces of evidence separately. An attention layer between the claim and evidence representation computes alignment scores to identify relevant terms between both. Finally, a classification layer receives the vector representation of claims and evidence and performs the relevance and verification classification. Our model allows a more straightforward interpretation of the predictions than other state-of-the-art models. We use the scores computed within the attention layer to show which evidence spans are more relevant to classify a claim as supported or refuted.

The literature has identified political bias as one of the main predictors of belief and spread of fake news. However, the academic debate has not been consensual regarding the effect of political identity on the discernment of fake news. This systematic literature review (2017–2021) seeks to understand whether there is consistent evidence that one political identity may be more vulnerable to fake news than others. Focusing the analysis on European and North American (United States) studies, we used Scopus and Web of Science databases to examine the literature. Our findings revealed that most studies are consistent in identifying the conservative or right-wing audience as more vulnerable to fake news. Although there seems to be a motivated political reasoning for both sides, left-wing people or liberals were not, in any analyzed study, associated with a greater propensity to believe in political fake news. Motivated reasoning seems stronger and more active among conservatives, both in the United States and Europe. Our study reinforces the need to intensify the fight against the proliferation of fake news among the most conservative, populist, and radical right audience.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

Scholars have discussed many angles of this behavior and emphasized repertoires based on specific contentious actions. However, little is discussed about how these disputes allow us to apprehend different models of political action in polarized contexts. On a whole, studies have not considered a broader understanding of digital activism performed by supporters of far-right governments. How does the far-right spread its agenda and support the government in â€œhashtag warsâ€? What kind of strategies are employed? This study seeks to compare patterns of coordinated behavior in hashtags created by supporters and detractors of the Bolsonaro government in Brazil that occupied the trending topics on Twitter. The statistical analysis is based on 6.1 million tweets taken from 20 political hashtags collected over a three-month period from May to July 2020. Data was scraped using Twitterâ€™s Search API v3.0 for academic use. We analyzed the overall volume and peaks of tweets, the users they engaged with, and their network of influence, as well as the length of each hashtag. The results show an intense use of hashtag activism by Bolsonaro supporters, with users struggling for greater prominence in social media in the face of political events in Brazil. This article sheds light on how the far-right appropriates digital platforms to promote the governmentâ€™s public image in times of political tension and how it promotes coordinated actions aimed at framing social media audiences.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022.

The study also aimed to construct a framework for fake news disaster management to control the dangers of false news on DM. The study applied PRISMA guidelines and techniques for exploring, devising, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search was carried out through 15 of the worldâ€™s leading digital databases. As a result, 31 peer-reviewed studies published in impact-factor journals of leading databases were included. Findings showed that several factors influenced the sharing of fake news on digital media (DM) platforms. Six major trending factors were the rise of technologies, social connections, political reasons, the absence of a controlling center, online business and marketing, and quick dissemination of information. The study identified the disadvantages of fake news (FN) on digital media (DM). A framework was constructed for managing fake news disasters to control the spread of fake news on digital media. This paper offers important theoretical contributions through the development of a framework for controlling fake news spread on digital media and by providing a valuable addition to the existing body of knowledge. The study offers practical assistance to top management, decision makers, and policymakers to devise policies to effectively manage problems caused by fake news dissemination. It provides practical strategies to address fake news disasters on digital media for redefining social values. This research also assists digital media managers in utilizing the proposed framework and controlling the harmful impact of fake news on social media.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

However, social bots can interfere with the social media topics that humans follow. We analyzed and visualized Twitter data during the prevalence of the Wuhan lab leak theory and discovered that 29% of the accounts participating in the discussion were social bots. We found evidence that social bots play an essential mediating role in communication networks. Although human accounts have a more direct influence on the information diffusion network, social bots have a more indirect influence. Unverified social bot accounts retweet more, and through multiple levels of diffusion, humans are vulnerable to messages manipulated by bots, driving the spread of unverified messages across social media. These findings show that limiting the use of social bots might be an effective method to minimize the spread of conspiracy theories and hate speech online.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, a review of the existing studies is conducted to understand and curtail the dissemination of fake news. Specifically, we conducted a benchmark study using a wide range of (1) classical ML algorithms such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB) and an ensemble learning method of such algorithms, (2) advanced ML algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-BiGRU and a hybrid approach of such techniques and (3) DL transformer-based models such as BERTbase and RoBERTabase. The experiments are carried out using different pretrained word embedding methods across four well-known real-world fake news datasets—LIAR, PolitiFact, GossipCop and COVID-19—to examine the performance of different techniques across various datasets. Furthermore, a comparison is made between context-independent embedding methods (e.g., GloVe) and the effectiveness of BERTbase—contextualised representations in detecting fake news. Compared with the state of the artâ€™s results across the used datasets, we achieve better results by solely relying on news text. We hope this study can provide useful insights for researchers working on fake news detection.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

We present the results in a ranking. Forty-two media based in Spain have Telegram channels, 26 of which are ranked in the directory. Less than half of these channels are verified by the platform, and only three are linked to their website. This lack of verification could lead to the proliferation of fake channels.

The analysis reveals six key articulations: pseudo-legal actions and language, political conspiracies, medical and scientific language and expertise, war analogies, activist rhetoric and tactics, and family values. These discursive articulations disclose linkages between concepts that are usually contradictory but are bonded together in the conjecture moment of the pandemic.

The broader goal is to understand why fact-checking seems to have inconsistent effects on the beliefs and behavioral intentions about disinformation. 10;Design/methodology/approachAn online experiment was conducted in a public health (COVID-19) context with 429 validated participants to test three hypotheses linking the main and interaction effects of two independent variables (news source credibility and fact-checker credibility) on three dependent variables (users' believability, reading intention and sharing intention of online news claims). The data was analyzed using multilevel (fixed effects) models controlling for individual differences, claim differences and order effects.FindingsThe author observed a nuanced pattern of effects; news source credibility had a positive main effect on believability but negative effects on reading and sharing intention; fact-checking credibility had a positive main effect on believability, but no effects on reading or sharing intentions, but negatively moderated the effects of source credibility on all three dependent variables.Originality/valueThis paper introduces, conceptualizes and tests whether a more credible fact-checker shapes the beliefs and intentions about online misinformation differently from less credible fact-checkers, especially when examined concurrently with similar effects of the original sources of misinformation claims. Additionally, it suggests that, on average, users have a low perception of credibility for fact-checkers (even reputed ones), which may explain why fact-checking is often ineffective in shaping the beliefs and intended behaviors.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © Anol Bhattacherjee.

In particular, social networking services (SNSs) can easily spread information of uncertain authenticity and factuality. Although many studies have proposed methods that addressed how to suppress the spread of misinformation on SNSs, few works have examined the impact on society of diffusing both misinformation and its corrective information. This study models the effects of effort to reduce misinformation and the diffusion of corrective information on social disruption, and it clarifies these effects. With the aim of reducing the impact on social disruption, we show that not only misinformation but also corrective information can cause social disruption, and we clarify how to control the spread of the latter to limit its impact. We analyzed the misinformation about a toilet-paper shortage and its correction as well as the social disruption this event caused in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. First, (1) we analyzed the extent to which misinformation and its corrections spread on SNS, and then (2) we created a model to estimate the impact of misinformation and its corrections on the world. Finally, (3) We used our model to analyze the change in this impact when the diffusion of the misinformation and its corrections changed. Based on our analysis results in (1), the corrective information spread much more widely than the misinformation. From the model developed in (2), the corrective information caused excessive purchasing behavior. The analysis results in (3) show that the amount of corrective information required to minimize the societal impact depends on the amount of misinformation diffusion. Most previous studies concentrated on the impact of corrective information on attitudes toward misinformation. On the other hand, the most significant contribution of this study is that it focuses on the impact of corrective information on society and clarifies the appropriate amount of it.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 Iizuka et al.

This research aimed to analyze the science and health-related hoaxes that were spread during the pandemic with the objectives of (1) identifying the characteristics of the form and content of such false information, and the platforms used to spread them, and (2) formulating a typology that can be used to classify the different types of hoaxes according to their connection with scientific information. The study was conducted by analyzing the content of hoaxes which were debunked by the three main fact-checking organizations in Spain in the three months following WHOâ€™s announcement of the pandemic (N = 533). The results indicated that science and health content played a prominent role in shaping the spread of these hoaxes during the pandemic. The most common hoaxes on science and health involved information on scientific research or health management, used text, were based on deception, used real sources, were international in scope, and were spread through social networks. Based on the analysis, we proposed a system for classifying science and health-related hoaxes, and identified four types according to their connection to scientific knowledge: â€œhastyâ€ science, decontextualized science, badly interpreted science, and falsehood without a scientific basis. The rampant propagation and widespread availability of disinformation point to the need to foster media and scientific caution and literacy among the public and increase awareness of the importance of timing and substantiation of scientific research. The results can be useful in improving media literacy to face disinformation, and the typology we formulate can help develop future systems for automated detection of health and science-related hoaxes.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 León et al.

Such systems, however, assume that users are impartial arbiters of truth. This assumption might be unwarranted, as users might be influenced by their own political biases and tolerance for opposing points of view, besides considering the truth value of a news item. In this paper we simulate a scenario in which users on one side of the polarity spectrum have different tolerance levels for the opinions of the other side. We create a model based on some assumptions about online news consumption, including echo chambers, selective exposure, and confirmation bias. A consequence of such a model is that news sources on the opposite side of the intolerant users attract more flags. We extend the base model in two ways: (i) by allowing news sources to find the path of least resistance that leads to a minimization of backlash, and (ii) by allowing users to change their tolerance level in response to a perceived lower tolerance from users on the other side of the spectrum. With these extensions, in the model we see that intolerance is attractive: news sources are nudged to move their polarity to the side of the intolerant users. Such a model does not support high-tolerance regimes: these regimes are out of equilibrium and will converge towards empirically-supported low-tolerance states under the assumption of partisan but rational users.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 Westermann, Coscia.

As a result, researchers have used data from these platforms to analyze public opinions and forecast election results. The literature has shown that due to inauthentic actors such as malicious social bots and trolls, not every message is a genuine expression from a legitimate user. However, the prevalence of inauthentic activities in social data streams is still unclear, making it difficult to gauge biases of analyses based on such data. In this article, we aim to close this gap using Twitter data from the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. We propose an efficient and low-cost method to identify voters on Twitter and systematically compare their behaviors with different random samples of accounts. We find that some accounts flood the public data stream with political content, drowning the voice of the majority of voters. As a result, these hyperactive accounts are over-represented in volume samples. Hyperactive accounts are more likely to exhibit various suspicious behaviors and to share low-credibility information compared to likely voters. Our work provides insights into biased voter characterizations when using social media data to analyze political issues.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 Yang et al.

Though much research has focused on how social media platforms connected people to election-related rumors and conspiracy theories, less is known about the search engine pathways that linked users to news content with the potential to undermine trust in elections. In this paper, we present novel data related to the content of political headlines during the 2020 US election period. We scraped over 800,000 headlines from Google's search engine results pages (SERP) in response to 20 election-related keywords—10 general (e.g., ""Ballots"") and 10 conspiratorial (e.g., ""Voter fraud"")—when searched from 20 cities across 16 states. We present results from qualitative coding of 5,600 headlines focused on the prevalence of delegitimizing information. Our results reveal that videos (as compared to stories, search results, and advertisements) are the most problematic in terms of exposing users to delegitimizing headlines. We also illustrate how headline content varies when searching from a swing state, adopting a conspiratorial search keyword, or reading from media domains with higher political bias. We conclude with policy recommendations on data transparency that allow researchers to continue to monitor search engines during elections.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022.

However, the OSN environment is quite slippery and hides potential risks: many studies presented evidence about the presence of d/misinformation campaigns and malicious activities by genuine or automated users, putting at severe risk the efficiency of online and offline political campaigns. This phenomenon is particularly evident during crucial political events, as political elections. In the present paper, we provide a comprehensive description of the networks of interactions among users and bots during the UK elections of 2019. In particular, we focus on the polarised discussion about Brexit on Twitter, analysing a data set made of more than 10 millions tweets posted for over a month. We found that the presence of automated accounts infected the debate particularly in the days before the UK national elections, in which we find a steep increase of bots in the discussion; in the days after the election day, their incidence returned to values similar to the ones observed few weeks before the elections. On the other hand, we found that the number of suspended users (i.e. accounts that were removed by the platform for some violation of the Twitter policy) remained constant until the election day, after which it reached significantly higher values. Remarkably, after the TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, we observed the injection of a large number of novel bots whose behaviour is markedly different from that of pre-existing ones. Finally, we explored the botsâ€™ political orientation, finding that their activity is spread across the whole political spectrum, although in different proportions, and we studied the different usage of hashtags and URLs by automated accounts and suspended users, targeting the formation of common narratives in different sides of the debate.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2022. corrected publication 2022.

By assigning the Twitter users an Untrustworthiness (U) score based on how frequently they engage with unreliable media outlets and cross-checking it with a qualitative political annotation of the communities, we show that such information consumption is not equally distributed across the Twitter users. Indeed, we identify clusters characterised by a very high presence of accounts that frequently share content from less reliable news sources. The users with high U are more keen to interact with bot-like accounts that tend to inject more unreliable content into the network and to retweet that content. Thus, our methodology applied to this real-world network provides evidence, in an easy and straightforward way, that there is strong interplay between accounts that display higher bot-like activity and users more focused on news from unreliable sources and that this influences the diffusion of this information across the network.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2022. corrected publication 2022.

Recent studies found that hyperpartisan bots are unlikely to influence public opinion because bots often interact with already highly polarized users. However, previous studies focused on direct human-bot interactions (e.g., retweets, at-mentions, and likes). The present study suggests that political bots, zealots, and trolls may indirectly affect peopleâ€™s views via a platformâ€™s content recommendation system's mediating role, thus influencing opinions without direct human-bot interaction. Using an agent-based opinion dynamics simulation, we isolated the effect of a single bot—representing 1% of nodes in a network—on the opinion of rational Bayesian agents when a simple recommendation system mediates the agentsâ€™ content consumption. We compare this experimental condition with an identical baseline condition where such a bot is absent. Across conditions, we use the same random seed and a psychologically realistic Bayesian opinion update rule so that conditions remain identical except for the bot presence. Results show that, even with limited direct interactions, the mere presence of the bot is sufficient to shift the average populationâ€™s opinion. Virtually all nodes—not only nodes directly interacting with the bot—shifted towards more extreme opinions. Furthermore, the mere botâ€™s presence significantly affected the internal representation of the recommender system. Overall, these findings offer a proof of concept that bots and hyperpartisan accounts can influence population opinions not only by directly interacting with humans but also by secondary effects, such as shifting platformsâ€™ recommendation enginesâ€™ internal representations. The mediating role of recommender systems creates indirect causal pathways of algorithmic opinion manipulation.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2022.

Various machine learning approaches have evaluated text and images to categorize false news over time, but they lack a comprehensive representation of relevant features. This paper presents an automated method for detecting fake news to counteract the spread of disinformation. The proposed multimodal EFND integrates contextual, social context, and visual data from news articles and social media to build a multimodal feature vector with a high level of information density. Using a multimodal factorized bilinear pooling, the gathered features are fused to improve their correlation and offer a more accurate shared representation. Finally, a Multilayer Perceptron is implemented over the shared representation for the classification of fake news. EFND is evaluated using a group of standard fake news datasets known as â€œFakeNewsNetâ€. EFND has outperformed the baseline and state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models. Furthermore, the results of ablation studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed framework. For the PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets, the EFND has achieved an accuracy of 0.988% and 0.990%, respectively.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

DeepFakes refer to face multimedia content, which has been digitally altered or synthetically created using deep neural networks. The paper first outlines the readily available face editing apps and the vulnerability (or performance degradation) of face recognition systems under various face manipulations. Next, this survey presents an overview of the techniques and works that have been carried out in recent years for deepfake and face manipulations. Especially, four kinds of deepfake or face manipulations are reviewed, i.e., identity swap, face reenactment, attribute manipulation, and entire face synthesis. For each category, deepfake or face manipulation generation methods as well as those manipulation detection methods are detailed. Despite significant progress based on traditional and advanced computer vision, artificial intelligence, and physics, there is still a huge arms race surging up between attackers/offenders/adversaries (i.e., DeepFake generation methods) and defenders (i.e., DeepFake detection methods). Thus, open challenges and potential research directions are also discussed. This paper is expected to aid the readers in comprehending deepfake generation and detection mechanisms, together with open issues and future directions.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023 by the author.

The phenomenon of spreading fake information and news creates significant concern for the public health and safety of the population. In this paper, we propose a disinformation detection framework based on multi-task learning (MTL) and meta-heuristic algorithms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The developed framework uses an MTL and a pre-trained transformer-based model to learn and extract contextual feature representations from Arabic social media posts. The extracted contextual representations are fed to an alternative feature selection technique which depends on modified version of the Fire Hawk Optimizer. The proposed framework, which aims to improve the disinformation detection rate, was evaluated on several datasets of Arabic social media posts. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve accuracy of 59%. It obtained, at best, precision, recall, and F-measure of 53%, 71%, and 53%, respectively, on all datasets; and it outperformed the other algorithms in all measures.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023 by the authors.

We conducted a systematic review of causal and correlational evidence (N&thinsp;=&thinsp;496 articles) on the link between digital media use and different political variables. Some associations, such as increasing political participation and information consumption, are likely to be beneficial for democracy and were often observed in autocracies and emerging democracies. Other associations, such as declining political trust, increasing populism and growing polarization, are likely to be detrimental to democracy and were more pronounced in established democracies. While the impact of digital media on political systems depends on the specific variable and system in question, several variables show clear directions of associations. The evidence calls for research efforts and vigilance by governments and civil societies to better understand, design and regulate the interplay of digital media and democracy.This systematic review on digital media and democracy finds beneficial relationships mostly in emerging democracies but detrimental associations in established democracies for different political variables across methods.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Evidence Based Healthcare; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2022.

A new approach recently proposed in scholarship and piloted on online platforms is to harness the wisdom of the crowd by enabling recipients of an online message to attach veracity assessments to it. The intention is to allow poor initial crowd reception to temper belief in and further spread of misinformation. We study this approach by letting 4000 subjects in 80 experimental bipartisan communities sequentially rate the veracity of informational messages. We find that in well-mixed communities, the public display of earlier veracity ratings indeed enhances the correct classification of true and false messages by subsequent users. However, crowd intelligence backfires when false information is sequentially rated in ideologically segregated communities. This happens because early ratersâ€™ ideological bias, which is aligned with a message, influences later ratersâ€™ assessments away from the truth. These results suggest that network segregation poses an important problem for community misinformation detection systems that must be accounted for in the design of such systems.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2023.

Although the digitalization progress of the media brings many advantages, it also increases the risk of spreading disinformation, misinformation, and malformation through the use of fake news. The emergence of this harmful phenomenon has managed to polarize society and manipulate public opinion on particular topics, e.g., elections, vaccinations, etc. Such information propagated on social media can distort public perceptions and generate social unrest while lacking the rigor of traditional journalism. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques are essential for developing efficient tools that can detect fake news. Models that use the context of textual data are essential for resolving the fake news detection problem, as they manage to encode linguistic features within the vector representation of words. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses document embeddings to build multiple models that accurately label news articles as reliable or fake. We also present a benchmark on different architectures that detect fake news using binary or multi-labeled classification. We evaluated the models on five large news corpora using accuracy, precision, and recall. We obtained better results than more complex state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network models. We observe that the most important factor for obtaining high accuracy is the document encoding, not the classification model's complexity.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023 by the authors.

Comparatively little is known about the campaign strategies used by each camp and how they leveraged the hybrid media environment to advocate for their positions. We analyse the cannabis legalisation referendum campaigns using primary data from our digital ethnographic study on Facebook, a systematic quantitative content analysis of legacy media websites, and a review of published reports from other authors. We show how positive sentiment towards cannabis law reform in the traditional media was amplified via referendum campaignersâ€™ activity on Facebook. While campaign expenses on both sides were similar, money was spent in different ways and via different mediums. The pro-legalisation campaign focused more on new digital media channels, while the anti-legalisation campaign diversified across a range of mediums, with greater attention paid to traditional political advertising strategies, such as leaflets and billboards. The New Zealand case study illustrates how greater engagement with the â€œnewerâ€ media logics may not necessarily secure a favourable outcome during a national referendum campaign. We discuss how the broader media and political environment may have influenced campaignersâ€™ choices to engage (or not) with the different media channels.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023.

Exploring the role of social bots in discussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as comparing the behavioral differences between social bots and humans, is an important foundation for studying public health opinion dissemination. We collected data on Twitter and used Botometer to classify users into social bots and humans. Machine learning methods were used to analyze the characteristics of topic semantics, sentiment attributes, dissemination intentions, and interaction patterns of humans and social bots. The results show that 22% of these accounts were social bots, while 78% were humans, and there are significant differences in the behavioral characteristics between them. Social bots are more concerned with the topics of public health news than humans are with individual health and daily lives. More than 85% of botsâ€™ tweets are liked, and they have a large number of followers and friends, which means they have influence on internet usersâ€™ perceptions about disease transmission and public health. In addition, social bots, located mainly in Europe and America countries, create an â€œauthoritativeâ€ image by posting a lot of news, which in turn gains more attention and has a significant effect on humans. The findings contribute to understanding the behavioral patterns of new technologies such as social bots and their role in the dissemination of public health information.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023 by the authors.

We hypothesized that this latter factor matters for the online spreading of news not least because online interactions, despite having the potential of being global, end up being localized: interaction probability is known to rapidly decay with distance. Upon analysis of more than 8M Reddit comments containing news links spanning four years, from January 2016 to December 2019, we found that Reddit did not work as an â€˜hype machineâ€™ for news (as opposed to what previous work reported for other platforms, circulation was not mainly caused by platform-facilitated network effects). Rather, news circulation in Reddit worked as a supply-and-demand system: news items scaled linearly with the number of users in each state (with a scaling exponent &beta;  &asymp;1, and a goodness of fit R2&asymp;0.95). Furthermore, deviations from such a universal pattern were best explained by state-level personality and cultural factors (R2&asymp;{0.12,0.39}), rather than socioeconomic conditions (R2&asymp;{0.15,0.29}) or political characteristics (R2&asymp;{0.06,0.21}). Higher-than-expected circulation of any type of news was found in states characterised by residents who tend to be less diligent in terms of their personality (low in conscientiousness) and by loose cultures understating the importance of adherence to norms (low in cultural tightness). Interestingly, the combination of those factors with low levels of education was then associated with the circulation of a particular type of news, that is, misinformation. These results suggest that online interactions are geographically bounded and, as such, news circulation cannot be studied purely as an Internet phenomenon but should be grounded into a userâ€™s offline cultural environment, which has become increasingly segregated over the decades, and is admittedly hard to change.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © The Author(s) 2023.

Many methods based on deep neural networks learn clues from claim content and message propagation structure or temporal information, which have been widely recognized. However, firstly, such models ignore the fact that information quality is uneven in propagation, which makes semantic representations unreliable. Additionally, most models do not fully leverage spatial and temporal structures in combination. Finally, internal decision-making processes and results are non-transparent and unexplained. In this study, we developed a trust-aware evidence reasoning and spatiotemporal feature aggregation model for more interpretable and accurate fake news detection. Specifically, we first designed a trust-aware evidence reasoning module to calculate the credibility of posts based on a random walk model to discover high-quality evidence. Next, from the perspective of spatiotemporal structure, we designed an evidence-representation module to capture the semantic interactions granularly and enhance the reliable representation of evidence. Finally, a two-layer capsule network was designed to aggregate the implicit bias in evidence while capturing the false portions of source information in a transparent and interpretable manner. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed model can provide explanations for fake news detection results, and can also achieve better performance, boosting the F1-score 3.5% on average.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023 by the authors.

However, in studies on the Arabic language, machine learning or deep learning algorithms were utilised to analyse sentiment and emotion more often than current pre-trained language models. Additionally, further pre-training the language model on specific tasks (i.e., within-task and cross-task adaptation) has not yet been investigated for Arabic in general, and for the sentiment and emotion task in particular. In this paper, we adapt a BERT-based Arabic pretrained language model for the sentiment and emotion tasks by further pre-training it on a sentiment and emotion corpus. Hence, we developed five new Arabic models: QST, QSR, QSRT, QE3, and QE6. Five sentiment and two emotion datasets spanning both small- and large-resource settings were used to evaluate the developed models. The adaptation approaches significantly enhanced the performance of seven Arabic sentiment and emotion datasets. The developed models showed excellent improvements over the sentiment and emotion datasets, which ranged from 0.15–4.71%.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023 by the authors.

However, its relevance has been called into question due to its controversy and ambiguity. We have compiled herein 30 definitions from selected dictionaries, academic papers, news agencies, influential media observatories, and independent, certified fact-checkers over the last six years and have carried out a manual relational content analysis on them. We also collected data from four bibliometric studies from academic literature and five surveys on how the general public perceived fake news. In keeping with this three-level systematic review (lexicography, bibliometrics, and public perception) we detected some trends, including a growing drift towards a post-truth-driven conceptualization of fake news. Results also show that the â€œviralâ€ and â€œmemeticâ€ quality of a rumor prevail over the demonstrable credibility of a source and even the factuality of a reported event; the element of surprise or outrage in the heat of the moment is more powerful than the ironic detachment elicited by news satire and parody; and sharing motivations are definitely less concerned with perceived accuracy than with partisan support, community sentiment, emotional contagion, and a taste for the sensational or bizarre.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023.

This includes: data on the presence of news titles both on proprietary platforms (print, radio, TV or app) in addition to their websites, and on external platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Telegram); their geographic scope (hyperlocal, local/regional or national/global); their subject (general or specialized coverage); and on ownership and language used. Almost 70% of the media were regional or local, while 60% covered general news, and one in three were linked to a print product, almost as many as those with their own app for users. Social media uptake is so widespread that more than 95% of the sites are on Facebook, with a similar number on Twitter, while more than 60% can be found on YouTube, and similarly on Instagram. Among specialized sites, sport is the largest category, comprising twice as many digital-native sites (106) than sites with traditional roots (46). The entertainment focus expands in the digital environment, and online-originated culture, business and science and technology outlets also outnumber legacy publications.Alternate abstract:Los medios digitales se han convertido en una parte integral de la industria del periodismo y de los hÃ¡bitos de la audiencia: en 2021, nuestra investigaciÃ³n registrÃ³ 2.873 sitios web de noticias activos en EspaÃ±a.

En primer lloc, aquest article explora les tendÃ¨ncies que afronten els mitjans periodÃ­stics digitals; desprÃ©s, estableix els criteris utilitzats per identificar una marca de notÃ­cies com a nadiua digital o no nadiua, i finalment presenta els resultats de la nostra classificaciÃ³. AixÃ² inclou: dades sobre la presÃ¨ncia de marques periodÃ­stiques tant en plataformes prÃ²pies (premsa, rÃ dio, TV, web i app), com en xarxes socials (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube i Telegram); el seu abast geogrÃ fic (hiperlocal, local/regional o nacional/global); la seva temÃ tica (cobertura general o especialitzada); la propietat i la llengua. Entre els resultats, destaca que gairebÃ© el 70% dels mitjans eren autonÃ²mics o locals, mentre que el 60% cobria notÃ­cies generals, i un de cada tres estava vinculat a algun producte imprÃ¨s, gairebÃ© tants com els que tenien una app prÃ²pia per als usuaris. Lâ€™acceptaciÃ³ de les xarxes socials estÃ  tan estesa que mÃ©s del 95% dels mitjans sÃ³n a Facebook, un nombre similar sÃ³n a Twitter i mÃ©s del 60% es poden trobar a YouTube i a Instagram. Entre els llocs especialitzats, lâ€™esport Ã©s la categoria mÃ©s gran en els mitjans nadius digitals (106), que suposen mÃ©s del doble dels mitjans no nadius especialitzats en aquesta temÃ tica (46). AixÃ­ mateix, lâ€™atenciÃ³ a lâ€™entreteniment sâ€™amplia en lâ€™entorn digital, i els mitjans nadius digitals centrats en cultura, negocis i ciÃ¨ncia i tecnologia superen en nombre les publicacions tradicionals.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023.

We suggest, however, that social influence—specifically as exercised by an authoritarian leader—might matter more if one is expected to agree with the fake news. We developed a single-item prototype measure of leadership styles and recruited participants from four Western democratic countries (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, United States, N&thinsp;=&thinsp;501) who identified their immediate boss as an autonomous, paternalistic, or authoritarian leader. Then they were asked to evaluate the accuracy of several fake news articles and their expectations to agree with their boss when asked about these articles. People with authoritarian bosses were less accurate in spotting fake news (Cohenâ€™s d&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.32) compared to employees with autonomous bosses. The bigger effect, however, was that they would agree with their boss about the fake news article when it was shared by their authoritarian boss compared to employees with autonomous (Cohenâ€™s d&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.30) or paternalistic bosses (Cohenâ€™s d&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.70). We argue that in addition to effects on the perceived accuracy of information, social influence, conformity, and obedience are crucial and unacknowledged factors of how misinformation may be maintained and propagated by authoritarian leaders.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © Springer Nature Limited 2023.

This would bring financial and reputational incentives for engagement, which might lead users to post more objectionable content. Previous research showed that financial or reputational incentives for accuracy decrease the willingness to share misinformation. However, it is unclear to what extent such outcome would change if engagements instead of accuracy were incentivized, which is a more realistic scenario. To address this question, we conducted a survey experiment to examine the effects of hypothetical token incentives. We find that a simple nudge about the possibility of earning token-based points for the achieved user engagements increases the willingness to share different kinds of news, including misinformation. The presence of penalties for objectionable posts diminishes the positive effect of tokenization rewards on misinformation sharing, but it does not eliminate it. These results have policy implications for content moderation practices if platforms embrace decentralization and engagement tokenization.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © Springer Nature Limited 2023.

Integrating AI into Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is now ushering in an era of social progress that has the potential to empower marginalized groups. This transformation paves the way to a digital inclusion that could qualitatively empower the online presence of women, particularly in conservative and male-dominated regions. To explore this possibility, we investigated the effect of integrating conversational agents into online debates encompassing 240 Afghans discussing the fall of Kabul in August 2021. We found that the agent leads to quantitative differences in how both genders contribute to the debate by raising issues, presenting ideas, and articulating arguments. We also found increased ideation and reduced inhibition for both genders, particularly females, when interacting exclusively with other females or the agent. The enabling character of the conversational agent reveals an apparatus that could empower women and increase their agency on online platforms.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © Springer Nature Limited 2023.

Malicious dissemination of harmful, offensive or illegal content may lead to misleading, misunderstanding and social unrest, affecting social stability and sustainable economic development. With the continuous iteration of artificial intelligence technology, researchers have carried out automatic and intelligent news data mining and analysis based on aspects of information characteristics and realized the effective identification of fake news information. However, the current research lacks the application of multidisciplinary knowledge and research on the interpretability of related methods. This paper focuses on the existing fake news detection technology. The survey includes fake news datasets, research methods for fake news detection, general technical models and multimodal related technical methods. The innovation contribution is to discuss the research progress of fake news detection in communication, linguistics, psychology and other disciplines. At the same time, it classifies and summarizes the explainable fake news detection methods and proposes an explainable human-machine-theory triangle communication system, aiming at establishing a people-centered, sustainable human–machine interaction information dissemination system. Finally, we discuss the promising future research topics of fake news detection technology.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023 by the authors.

Background: Although COVID-19 negatively impacted short-term fertility expectations, preferences, and behaviors in the United States, it remains unknown whether the pandemic contributed to changes in family size ideals more broadly. Method: The sample consists of 1823 respondents from the General Social Survey (GSS) who were originally interviewed before the COVID-19 pandemic (in 2016 and 2018) and were re-interviewed in the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (in August/September 2020), a period when pandemic-related stress and uncertainty was particularly pronounced. A within-person fixed effects approach is utilized. Results: Findings from within-person fixed effects analyses suggested that the pandemic had no impact on the quantum of ideal family size responses. These findings were robust to alternative specifications and were similar to what was observed in a parallel analysis of how the Great Recession impacted ideal family size. Conclusion: Findings pointed to stability in ideal family size in the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Implications: Future work should explore the disjuncture between short-term fertility intentions and behaviors and longer-term family size ideals.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In various forms, this common assumption has been reported, investigated, or implemented in fake news education programs. Some have associated this assumption with the inverse claim, that distractions from analytical thinking may render us vulnerable to believing or spreading fake news. This paper surveys the research done between 2016 and 2022 on psychological factors influencing oneâ€™s susceptibility to believing or spreading fake news, considers which of the psychological factors are plausible distractors to oneâ€™s exercise of analytical thinking, and discusses some implications of considering them as distractors to analytical thinking. From these, the paper draws five conclusions: (1) It is not analytical thinking per se, but analytical thinking directed to evaluating the truth that safeguards us from believing or spreading fake news. (2) While psychological factors can distract us from exercising analytical thinking and they can also distract us in exercising analytical thinking. (3) Whether a psychological factor functions as a distractor from analytical thinking or in analytical thinking may depend on contextual factors. (4) Measurements of analytical thinking may not indicate vulnerability to believing or spreading fake news. (5) The relevance of motivated reasoning to our tendency to believe fake news should not yet be dismissed.

To address the issue, previous studies mainly develop supervised learning models to identify bias at the article level, which not only requires expensive data collection but also careful features selection. An alternative approach to combat media bias focuses on the source level, which can help news aggregators promptly filter unreliable news based on their sources. Despite being a promising approach, the detection of biases at the source level remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised framework to estimate presentation bias of news sources. The framework first uses a retrieval engine to form groups of related articles, then constructs pairwise biases between news sources using Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) and finally, assigns bias scores for each source with a graph-based algorithm. Using a dataset of approximately 83K articles from 14 news sources, we validate the results of our framework with 3 benchmarks and find that our approach can provide reliable bias ratings, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of up to 0.92. We further discuss the possibility of extending the framework to identify selection bias. © 2020 IEEE.","RAYYAN-LABELS: dataset | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Included"", ""Davide""=>""Included""}",10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377987,media bias;politics;sentiment analysis;Correlation methods;Graph algorithms;Graphic methods;Sentiment analysis;Data collection;Features selection;Graph-based algorithms;News aggregators;Pearson correlation coefficients;Presentation bias;Retrieval engines;Selection bias;Big data;Bias (Epidemiology),,,09/11/2023

Because of its harmful effects at reinforcing one's bias and the posterior behavior of people, hyperpartisan news detection has become an important task for computational linguists. In this paper, we evaluate two different approaches to detect hyperpartisan news. First, a text masking technique that allows us to compare style vs. topic-related features in a different perspective from previous work. Second, the transformer-based models BERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and M-BERT, known for their ability to capture semantic and syntactic patterns in the same representation. Our results corroborate previous research on this task in that topic-related features yield better results than style-based ones, although they also highlight the relevance of using higher-length n-grams. Furthermore, they show that transformer-based models are more effective than traditional methods, but this at the cost of greater computational complexity and lack of transparency.

Due to a growing number of such media, a need for automatic detection approaches is of high demand. Automatic detection relies on various indicators (e.g. content characteristics) to identify new partisan media candidates and to predict their level of partisanship. The aim of the research is to investigate to a deeper extent whether it would be appropriate to rely on the hyperlinks as possible indicators for better automatic partisan news media detection. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilized hyperlink network analysis to study the hyperlinks of partisan and mainstream media. The dataset involved the hyperlinks of 18 mainstream media and 15 partisan media in Slovakia and Czech Republic. More than 171 million domain pairs of inbound and outbound hyperlinks of selected online news media were collected with Ahrefs tool, analyzed and visualized with Gephi software. Additionally, 300 articles covering COVID-19 from both types of media were selected for content analysis of hyperlinks to verify the reliability of quantitative analysis and to provide more detailed analysis. Findings: The authors conclude that hyperlinks are reliable indicators of media affinity and linking patterns could contribute to partisan news detection. The authors found out that especially the incoming links with dofollow attribute to news websites are reliable indicators for assessing the type of media, as partisan media rarely receive links with dofollow attribute from mainstream media. The outgoing links are not such reliable indicators as both mainstream and partisan media link to mainstream sources similarly. Originality/value: In contrast to the extensive amount of research aiming at fake news detection within a piece of text or multimedia content (e.g. news articles, social media posts), the authors shift to characterization of the whole news media. In addition, the authors did a geographical shift from more researched US-based media to so far under-researched European context, particularly Central Europe. The results and conclusions can serve as a guide how to derive new features for an automatic detection of possibly partisan news media by means of artificial intelligence (AI).

The use of deliberate misinformation is thought to have played a role in the outcome of the UK EU referendum, the 2016 US presidential election, and in the effectiveness of COVID-19 public health messaging. As a result, recent research has tended to focus on hyper-partisan (e.g., US politics; Democrat/Republican), person specific (e.g., Hillary Clinton/Donald Trump) content that incorporates emotive and hyperbolic language. However, in this study, we focus on an alternative form of fake news, across a variety of topics (e.g., Crime, Immigration, and Health), that avoids these characteristics, and which may therefore be more pervasive and difficult to detect. In a three-part study, we examined participants sharing intentions for fake news (including platform preference; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp), their ability to explicitly detect fake news, and whether individual differences on psychological measures of critical thinking ability, rational thinking, and emotional stability predict sharing behavior and detection ability. The results show that even our well-informed sample (political science students) were not immune to the effects of fake news, some issues (e.g., health and crime) were more likely to be shared than others (e.g., immigration), and on specific platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook). In addition, we show that individual differences in emotional stability appears to be a key factor in sharing behavior, while rational thinking aptitude was key to fake news detection. Taken together, this study provides novel data that can be used to support targeted fake news interventions, suggesting possible news topic, sharing behavior, and platform specific insights. Such interventions, and implications for government policy, education, and social media companies are discussed.

Despite the deployment of sophisticated computational systems to identify fake news, as well as the streamlining of fact-checking methods, appropriate fake news detection mechanisms have not yet been found. In fact, technological approaches are likely to be inefficient, given that fake news are based mostly on partisanship and identity politics, and not necessarily on outright deception. However, as disinformation is inherently expressed linguistically, this is a privileged room for forensic linguistic analysis. This article builds upon a forensic linguistic analysis of fake news pieces published in English and in Portuguese, which were collected since 2019 from acknowledged fake news outlets. The preliminary empirical analysis reveals that fake news pieces employ particular linguistic features, e.g. at the levels of typography, orthography and spelling, and morphosyntax. The systematic identification of these features, which will allow mapping linguistic resources and patterns used in those contexts, contributes to scholarship, not only by enabling a streamlined development of computational detection systems, but more importantly by permitting the forensic linguistics expert to assist criminal investigations and give evidence in court. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","RAYYAN-LABELS: language,Linguistic | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Michele ""=>""Excluded"", ""Davide""=>""Excluded"", } | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: other_political_detection_tas,other_political_detection_task",10.1007/s11196-022-09901-w,Cybercrime;Disinformation;Fact-checking;Fake news;Forensic linguistics;Language crimes,,,10/11/2023

An influential account posits that political partisanship pervasively biases reasoning, such that engaging in analytic thinking exacerbates motivated reasoning and, in turn, the acceptance of hyper- partisan content. Alternatively, it may be that susceptibility to hyperpartisan content is explained by a lack of reasoning. Across two studies using different participant pools (total N = 1,973 Americans), we had participants assess true, false, and hyperpartisan news headlines taken from social media. We found no evidence that analytic thinking was associated with judging politically consistent hyperpartisan or false headlines to be accurate and unbiased. Instead, analytic thinking was, in most cases, associated with an increased tendency to distinguish true headlines from both false and hyperpar- tisan headlines (and was never associated with decreased discernment). These results suggest that reasoning typically helps people differentiate between low and high qual- ity political news, rather than facilitate belief in misleading content. Because social media play an important role in the dissemination of misinformation, we also inves- tigated willingness to share headlines on social media. We found a similar pattern whereby analytic thinking was not generally associated with increased willingness to share hyperpartisan or false headlines. Together, these results suggest a positive role for reasoning in resisting misinformation. © 2021, Society for Judgment and Decision making.

Evidence points to partisan segmentation in the contemporary news market, but while assumptions abound, the mechanism driving consumers to sort along party lines is unclear. I develop a framework for news choice based on perceptions of objectivity and credibility and report a test of its central mechanism using a nationally representative survey experiment. I find support for a congenial media effect, where news content from an unfamiliar source is seen as more credible and less biased when it is consistent with existing beliefs, while balanced news content may be dismissed as less credible and biased. Previous studies have examined how perceptions of bias in identical news content can change when it is attributed to different sources. In todayâ€™s media world however, access to more news sources generally and the ease with which content from those sources can be shared makes it increasingly likely people will be exposed to news content from either unknown or potentially fake news sources. This study contributes to the literature by identifying the unique effect of message content on perceptions of news bias and source credibility, while holding source constant. Paradoxically, my findings indicate that political selective exposure may arise out of individualsâ€™ genuine desire for unbiased news.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Political Behavior is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

Much of the scholarship on it to date has focused on the â€˜fakenessâ€™ of fake news, illuminating the kinds of deception involved and the motivations of those who deceive. This study looks at the â€˜newsnessâ€™ of fake news by examining the extent to which it imitates the characteristics and conventions of traditional journalism. Through a content analysis of 886 fake news articles, we find that in terms of news values, topic, and formats, articles published by fake news sites look very much like traditional—and real—news. Most of their articles included the news values of timeliness, negativity, and prominence; were about government and politics; and were written in an inverted pyramid format. However, one point of departure is in terms of objectivity, operationalized as the absence of the authorâ€™s personal opinion. The analysis found that the majority of articles analyzed included the opinion of their author or authors.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021.

The dissemination of this type of news poses a serious threat to cohesion and social well-being, since it fosters political polarization and the distrust of people with respect to their leaders. The huge amount of news that is disseminated through social media makes manual verification unfeasible, which has promoted the design and implementation of automatic systems for fake news detection. The creators of fake news use various stylistic tricks to promote the success of their creations, with one of them being to excite the sentiments of the recipients. This has led to sentiment analysis, the part of text analytics in charge of determining the polarity and strength of sentiments expressed in a text, to be used in fake news detection approaches, either as a basis of the system or as a complementary element. In this article, we study the different uses of sentiment analysis in the detection of fake news, with a discussion of the most relevant elements and shortcomings, and the requirements that should be met in the near future, such as multilingualism, explainability, mitigation of biases, or treatment of multimedia elements.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

As people are free to express their opinions on social media, much information shared on the internet is loaded with propaganda. Propagandist contents are intended to influence public opinion. In the mainstream media or prominent news agencies, the authorsâ€™ and news agenciesâ€™ own bias may impact in the news contents. Hence, it is required to detect such propaganda spread through news articles. Detection and classification of propagandist text require standard, high-quality, annotated datasets. A few datasets are available for propaganda classification. However, these datasets are mostly in English. Hindi is the most spoken language in India, and efforts are needed to detect its propagandist contents. This research work introduces two new datasets: H-Prop and H-Prop-News, which consist of news articles in Hindi annotated as propaganda or non-propaganda. The H-Prop dataset is generated by translating 28,630 news articles from the QProp dataset. The H-Prop-News dataset contains 5500 news articles collected from 32 prominent Hindi news websites. We experiment with the proposed datasets using four supervised machine learning models combined with different feature vectors and word embeddings. Our experiments achieve 87% accuracy using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF feature vectors. The datasets provide high-quality labeled news articles in Hindi and open new avenues for researchers to explore techniques for analyzing and classifying propaganda in Hindi text.Dataset:https://zenodo.org/record/5828240#.YduLv2hBxPY.Dataset License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

Users are keen to participate in discussions on hot topics and exchange opinions on social media. A lot of fake news has also arisen at this moment. However, existing fake news detection methods have the problem of relying too much on textual features. Textual features are easy to be tampered with and deceive the detector; thus, it is difficult to distinguish fake news only by relying on textual features. To address the challenge, we propose a fake news detection method based on the diffusion growth rate (Delta-G). To identify the real and fake news, Delta-G uses graph convolutional networks to extract the diffusion structure features and then adopts the long-short-term memory networks to extract the growth rate features on time series. In the experiments, Delta-G is verified on two news datasets, Twitter and Weibo. Compared with the three detection methods of decision tree classifier, support vector machines with a propagation tree kernel, and RvNN, the accuracy of the Delta-G on the two datasets is improved by an average of 5% or more, which is better than all the baselines.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: Copyright © 2022 Jinyin Chen et al.

Basel","Political perspective detection in news media—identifying political bias in news articles—is an essential but challenging low-resource task. Prompt-based learning (i.e., discrete prompting and prompt tuning) achieves promising results in low-resource scenarios by adapting a pre-trained model to handle new tasks. However, these approaches suffer performance degradation when the target task involves a textual domain (e.g., a political domain) different from the pre-training task (e.g., masked language modeling on a general corpus). In this paper, we develop a novel multi-stage prompt tuning framework for political perspective detection. Our method involves two sequential stages: a domain- and task-specific prompt tuning stage. In the first stage, we tune the domain-specific prompts based on a masked political phrase prediction (MP3) task to adjust the language model to the political domain. In the second task-specific prompt tuning stage, we only tune task-specific prompts with a frozen language model and domain-specific prompts for downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms fine-tuning (i.e., model tuning) methods and state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods on the SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection and AllSides datasets.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023 by the authors.

Despite considerable success, however, we may still ask whether results may be improved further by combining these models with additional text representations. To shed light on this issue, the present work describes a series of experiments to compare a number of strategies for political bias and ideology inference from text data using sequence-based BERT models, syntax-and semantics-driven features, and examines which of these representations (or their combinations) improve overall model accuracy. Results suggest that one particular strategy - namely, the combination of BERT language models with syntactic dependencies - significantly outperforms well-known count- and sequence-based text classifiers alike. In particular, the combined model has been found to improve accuracy across all tasks under consideration, outperforming the SemEval hyperpartisan news detection top-performing system by up to 6%, and outperforming the use of BERT alone by up to 21%, making a potentially strong case for the use of heterogeneous text representations in the present tasks.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023.

This study proposes a modified proof-of-concept model named NER-SA, which integrates natural language processing (NLP) and named entity recognition (NER) to conduct the in-domain and cross-domain analysis of fake news detection with the existing three datasets simultaneously. The named entities associated with any particular news event exist in a finite and available evidence pool. Therefore, entities must be mentioned and recognized in this entity bank in any authentic news articles. A piece of fake news inevitably includes only some entitlements in the entity bank. The false information is deliberately fabricated with fictitious, imaginary, and even unreasonable sentences and content. As a result, there must be differences in statements, writing logic, and style between legitimate news and fake news, meaning that it is possible to successfully detect fake news. We developed a mathematical model and used the simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimal legitimate area. Comparing the detection performance of the NER-SA model with current state-of-the-art models proposed in other studies, we found that the NER-SA model indeed has superior performance in detecting fake news. For in-domain analysis, the accuracy increased by an average of 8.94% on the LIAR dataset and 19.36% on the fake or real news dataset, while the F1-score increased by an average of 24.04% on the LIAR dataset and 19.36% on the fake or real news dataset. In cross-domain analysis, the accuracy and F1-score for the NER-SA model increased by an average of 28.51% and 24.54%, respectively, across six domains in the FakeNews AMT dataset. The findings and implications of this study are further discussed with regard to their significance for improving accuracy, understanding context, and addressing adversarial attacks. The development of stylometric detection based on NLP approaches using NER techniques can improve the effectiveness and applicability of fake news detection.","Source type: Scholarly Journals; Object type: Article; Object type: Feature; Copyright: © 2023 by the author.

Current approaches are limited in their ability to generalise across regions and styles of journalism. This paper proposes a new approach that focusses on detecting rhetorical linguistic techniques rather than just analysing words or contextual representations. We compare three different systems based on different techniques for identifying media bias, including a lexical-based system, a language transformers-based system, and a cascade transformers system that relies on persuasive techniques detection. We have evaluated these systems using a Ukraine crisis news dataset and splitting it by according to the country to generate training and test sets, i.e. different sets for each country. The results of the cascade system outperforms by at least a 6% the other approaches in identifying media bias when evaluating with different countries setup. Our results suggest that models capable of detecting rhetorical and persuasive linguistic techniques are necessary to generalise media bias effectively.Alternate abstract:Detectar sesgo mediÃ¡tico es una tarea desafiante debido a la ambigÃ¼edad del lenguaje.
